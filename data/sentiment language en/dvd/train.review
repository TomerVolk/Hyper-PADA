0,"Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as ""Bring it on"", ""Clueless"", ""Mean Girls"" and, especially the superior ""Heathers"".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, ""John Tucker Must Die"" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. ""JTMD"" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. ""Heathers"" = 5 stars. ""Mean Girls"" = 4 stars. ""Bring it on"" = 4 stars. ""Clueless"" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that ""John Tucker Must Die"" doesnt have..

2,"This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker

4,"Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.
 
 
 I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.
 
 I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say ""I hated the ending, very predictable"" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.
 
 So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.
 
 If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.
 
 If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)
 
 And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie. 
 
 But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film

9,"This DVD is a good way to see what Houdini looked like.  That's it for the positive side of this review.  The story is ridiculous, Houdini does no magic and only one escape.  That escape is so poorly photographed, however, that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the ""wet sheet"" tie that was used in insane asylums at the time.  This film flopped at the theatres, and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece, ignoring the magic and escapes that made Houdini famous

10,"This DVD/CD combo is a very worthy effort by Coheed and Cambria. It includes all of their hit songs and they are a joy to watch live. The only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the DVD is sub-par. This doesnt mean that it is bad, it just isnt the kind of quality I would expect from a big time band like Coheed and Cambria. Even though the audio isnt that great, I still watch the thing all the time. The best part of this package is the CD that comes along with it. This is worth buying this product alone. I suggest putting the CD on full blast and watching the DVD on mute. All in all I give the DVD 3 out of 5 and the CD 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4. This should hold anyone that needs a Coheed fix until they put out their next C

12,"I generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films, while trying to be cutting edge, usually smack of just ""trying""...too hard.  I gave ""The Hamiltons"" a go since it received the most hype.  Wasn't impressed.  Yes, the ending has a nice little twist, and I was intrigued by seeing Lenny--although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming--the film lacks dramatic tension, contains mundane dialogue (victim: ""help me""; predator [whining]: ""I can't!), and characters are pretty much stock caricatures. 86 minutes drrrraggged by.

13,"I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's ""LA Freeway."" I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect. 
 The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.  
 
 This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little. 
 I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me. 
 When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a ""medley of my hit"" and sings ""Pancho and Lefty,"" and Rodney Crowell sang ""Bluebird Wine,"" both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's ""Alabama Highways"" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best.

14,"I was 4 years old when this movie was released, but I vividly remember Irene Cara's smash song of the same name in 1980 (especially the chorus of, ""Fame, I'm gonna live forever"") and, after so many years, I was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was I disappointed.
 
 I was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour.  The audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes.
 
 After this painful sequence, the movie finally gets underway.  I tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and couldn't do it.  I appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts (it IS hard work - everybody's an actor, dancer, and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it), and I definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment, but the movie just didn't flow for me.  Perhaps it would have to do with the fact that I'm not one of those people who isn't proclaiming to anyone who'll listen that I'm an ""actress"" (and who rolls their eyes at those people who do).
 
 Besides the slow pace of the story, ""Fame"" is very dated.  The off-the-shoulder top (that became the rage of the early-80s due to Cara's video) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that ""wonderful"" decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie.

 After so much publicity, trailers, ads on busses, you'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around. 
 However. I nearly fell asleep in it. Had to turn away more than a few times in boredom. And cliched to infinity, just watch the ending. 
 Pathetic and predictable. If you like predictable movies? This dvd will be your new best friend. If not? Try something with a bit more imagination

17,"This collection of three epochal films from Barbra Streisand's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker. All succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers.  
 
 The earliest is 1973's ""The Way We Were"", which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances. Veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents wrote a strong, multi-dimensional character for her in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling. 
 
 In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles.
 
 But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, ""The Way We Were: A Look Back"". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures. 
 
 The second film is 1991's ""The Prince of Tides"". In only her second directorial effort (after ""Yentl""), Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis. She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well. 
 
 The movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. It is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. 
 
 The movie is not without flaws. First, after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie's climax, the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein and a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Regardless, it's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.
 
 The last movie is the weakest of the trio, 1996's ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"", still her last starring vehicle. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably. At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale. 
 
 As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in ""The Prince of Tides"". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves. At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in ""The Owl and the Pussycat"") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role.
 
 This is a worthy collection for any Streisand fan

24,"For all the care they put into this fine, textured story of a pedophilia scandal in a Catholic orphanage in 1970s Newfoundland, the filmmakers can't let go of the conventional dichotomy of child abuse dramas: grim, teeth-gnashing villains and righteous, just-folks heroes.  It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama.  Henry Czerny, though, gives  a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part.  And the Canadians go further than American filmmakers ever could or would, suggesting how available the boys' bodies are, and what could be attractive about them.  Finally, the whole snowbound, wood-paneled production is goregous to look at.  Subject matter aside, if you doubt that Canada is a distinct place from the United States, take in the sights, sounds, and attitudes of this small epic

25,"The movie is not good but a lot can be learned by watching it through, even though it drags. The 1950s 'babe' played by Jayne is a period piece, but having lived in Las vegas for the past five years, I can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city. The  film is about a certain niche, created by men and probably by religion too,  and into this niche women step and become stigmatized. The whore or babe is  like the witch in the medieval period - something demonic and devilish. I  assure you, the values in the film are not out-of-date. The movie also is  an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism - espec.  Italian and the NYC area. And you see in this a connection to Las Vegas  too. The film, if it teaches anything, teaches us that we are far less  emancipated, liberated, rational, liberal, etc. in regard to sex and to  women than we thought we were. Again the parallel to witchcraft is a good  one: naive liberals thought the witch-hunting was over in the early 1700s.  In fact, witches were burned in all major European ocuntries into the late  1700s. And 1950s babes a la Mansfield are not only the adult identity of  many, especially in Las Vegas, in the year 2000, but are probably the  role-models of 6 and 7 year olds. ...

 What is it about a singer or comedian or actor that makes them think they have a firmer grasp of politics or foreign policy than those who have spent their lives studying and working in the field?
 
 This show just highlights that sort of egotistical celebrity folly - they sacrificed their sweet funny comedy act so that their political opinions could be heard - and all it accomplished was to make sure we didn't get to hear their funny comedy OR their political opinions!
 
 Why don't more entertainers just listen to Laura Ingrahm when she says -""Shut Up and Sing!"" ?

31,"Dancing on Dangerous Ground is best described as a ballet expressed through the medium of Irish dance. The costuming is modern and the acts form a very cohesive story (much more so than Riverdance), but the superposition of romance, tragedy, and war on a dance invented for celebration seems...contradictory at best. 
 
 The performance is technically excellent, and for some, the military scenes alone will make the DVD worth it. But the Irish Legend - a tale of a first officer and a queen who betray their king not unlike Lancelot and Guinevere - has Griana truncating her forms so as not to bounce too much during her lament, and both leads trying to express longing without breaking Irish posture during their romance. In that sense, watching Dancing on Dangerous Ground is kind of like admiring a painting of the sunset over a tropical beach done in glorious black and white. Even if you think black and white photography is beautiful, and love sunsets and the tropics, you end up wishing that the painter had chosen to change either the subject, or the medium. 
 
 The one place where medium and subject DO work well is in the military scenes, where Irish precision is put to amazing use; then the watcher can feel the rhythm and the power conveyed, even through the TV screen. But in the scenes in between, I found myself craving a no-hold-barred energetic number that expressed the joy of Irish dance (like the ones which made Riverdance famous), and wishing for the full upper-body expression of a ballet during some oddly stilted during laments and romantic scenes. 
 
 As an Irish dance piece it's well executed, and as a ballet the costuming is inventive and the music beautiful, but there's an odd quality to watching it. Sometimes it gives the impression of muted color, sometimes of undersold majesty, but always there's the feel that the passion, while *almost* there, is somehow still missing.

32,"I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but I guess if I had really thought about it, anything starring Joan Crawford at this point in her life, and the always rebellious/troubled/angry John Garfield, could not have risen above what the film ended up being. My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, ""okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!"" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her ""sorrow and pain""! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad. I am sure die hard Joan and John fans will always love this film, but all others should be able to see it for what it really is

Amy repeats important directions repeatedly and gives gentle reminder not to strain lower back or neck and to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.  This beginner set has been a very good starting point for me and she's right, I can feel my core getting stronger.  The 20 minutes go fast and  you learn what your body can do and build from there.

34,"Although I haven't bought this package, I've seen both films. 
 
 The first film was really great, it earned 5/5 stars right off the back.
 The fight scenes were intense, with some great, upbeat music playing. In addition to the intensity, there was a lot of first-person views. There There was a cliffhanger ending, though.
 
 The second film was OK, but not as good as the first one. It continues the first one, but they used totally different actors to play Raiden, Sonya, Jax, and Johnny Cage. I would give it a 4/5 stars because of the short fight scenes and over-use of slow motion. I would have given it a 3/5, but it earned a star for the awesome music. It was pretty good film, for those who appreciate the hard work of others

35,"Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole ""We're married and my husband's a doctor."" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and ""Dr. Holmes"" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?
 
 What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.
 
 Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?
 
 Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us ""don't do it!"" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!
 
 It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap

Some of the students go on to dance in a city-wide competition.  This documantary focuses on the children of three schools as they prepare for the showdown.  As many other reviewers have noted, the film would have benefitted from a finer focus on a smaller number of kids.  This would have allowed us to see more of their personal lives and place the program in its context.  Nervertheless, there are many joyful sequences in this film, and the children are charming.  Those qualities go a long way

38,"This film is about a young porn star who of course had tragedy in her life.  When she was 12 her mother committed suicide.  After her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops Parkinson's Disease.  At 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life.  She juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by Rosario Dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher.  I really enjoyed this film but couldn't help but feel like the actress who portrayed Moon was doing her best Angelina Jolie impersonation, I mean she had Angelina down pat.  James Wood deserves an Oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down. I enjoyed this film, but like many other films I was frustrated with the story at times.  It seemed to be all over the place sometimes.  I never knew if the love story between Moon and her blind date was going anywhere, then we see Mon venture off into a new business, then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis'.  Although it was all over the place at times, it was a great little indy film, the best indy film I have seen since ""Secretary.

However, I recently caught a performance of her from Mad TV, singing my favorite song from her second CD. I have to say it was incredible.

47,"The Care Bears movie is a wonderful movie for the whole family.  With great voice acting, including Mickey Rooney as the narrator, Mr. Cherrywood, this is a special treat that will warm your heart and make you laugh.  
 
 The opening song was written and sung by the great Carole King.  It sets the stage for what the Care Bears are all about.  In their clouds and rainbow filled Care-A-Lot, they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend.  Little stars flit about and help them.
 
 The story is about a magician's assistant named Nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit.  Nicholas has always felt lonely.  The evil spirit takes advantage of that, and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring.  This is almost too much for the gentle Care Bears.  Luckily, they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the Forest of Feelings with other cute critters.
 
 There are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful.  As far as this being a feature-length commercial, the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more Care Bear Cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge.  But that is minor.
 
 My husband even loved this movie and was humming along at the closing song!

48,"It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie

49,"I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't ""get it"" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part. 
 
 That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally ""get it"", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it

The boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him.  She and a reporter hire a boat to find her father.  Their destination is an island said to be cursed.  The boat they hire is run by a young couple.  Along the way the couple do some diving (she is topless).  She is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it.  She is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks.  The Continue to the island which is just a short distance away.
 
 Once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living.  Legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation.  Unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known.  But soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead.  In the end, only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization.  They keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy.
 
 This is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings.  That aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly.  There is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore, although somewhat tame by today's standards.  The acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent.  I enjoyed the ending which I gather was supposed to be a shocker but which I predicted from the beginning.  My guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead, or so the producers hoped.  If you like zombie films you will have to check this one out

53,"After pretty much laughing my (...) off while watching ""The Best Of Will Ferrell"", I expected to do the same with ""The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2"". However, when I watched it on tv in July, I was extremely disappointed. Outside of a few sketches, I hardly uttered a chuckle. However, when I saw this dvd a few weeks ago, I knew I had to buy it, thinking I might change my opinion. Needless to say, it remained the same.
 
 ""The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2"" is supposed to include sketches featuring some of Will's lesser known recurring characters that failed to make it on the (10 million times funnier) first volume, including rude and incompetent obstertrician Dr. Beamen, Hank of Bill Braskie's Buddies"", and Ted Brogan"", the 37 - year - old baby. Also there are some sketches that feature non - recurring bits. None of these sketches are funny.
 
 However, there are a few funny sketches. They are the opening Bush sequence, the famed ""Wake Up And Smile"", ""Lovers"" (though there's another version of this sketch with the same characters on volume one except it's with Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore and it's much funnier), ""Red Ships Of Spain"" (with Will doing his Robert Goulet impression), and ""Inside The Actors Studio"" with Kate Hudson as Drew Barrymore (though the one with Alec Baldwin as Charles Nelson Reilly on the first edition was much funnier).
 
 The only other watchable sketch is ""Janet Reno's Dance Party"", which really only catches fire when she beats up Mayor Rudolph Giulianni. It's pretty good, but Will impersonated Reno 13 times, so there are probably better Janet Reno sketches out there.
 
 Also, there are many much more funnier characters that didn't appear or only appeared briefly on the first volume that without a doubt should have been included here. I'm talking about Frank Henderson (from the ""Get Off The Shed"" bit), David Leary (from ""Dog Show""), Tom Wilkinson (from ""Morning Latte""), Sean Patrick Flannery (from the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches), Baron Nocturna (from ""Goth Talk""), Don West (from the ""Shopping At Home"" sketches), and his Ted Kaczynski and Neil Diamond (where's ""Storytellers"") impressions.
 
 And why not include more Culps, Spartans, Roxbury, ""Jeopardy!"", Harry Caray and Saddam Hussein sketches? Yeah, they were on volume one, but they were truly Will's best! And as a final gripe, they could have given us at least one of the Bush/Gore presidential debates sketches.
 
 Overall, you can say this is a complete abomination, but it is tempting. Buy at your own risk and hope that volume three comes out soon and it's much, much better than this dvd

So many real-life scenarios I felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days!  And every time I've watched it (and yes... that number is in the ""double"" digits) I always find something that I overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again, as if for the first time!  A true gem!  Feeling blue?  Just pop this movie... you'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours..

55,"Patriot Games is a good thriller based on the very famous Tom Clancy novel. This movie has good suspense, good action and a good conclusion. At times, the movie is slow moving and a little unrealisitc but hey..
 The movie's about an ex CIA guy, Jack Ryan played by Harrison Ford who goes on vacation with his wife and daughter. But, of course, something goes wrong. They go to London and Jack becomes a hero when he saves a higly ranked Englishman's life. But, in the process, he kills one of the terrorists that attacked him. And the brother of the guy he killed isn't pleased. And that terrorist and his pals go to the U.S to get revenge, mainly by targeting Ryan's wife and kid. So Ryan is on the most important case of his life where he has to save his family. The movie includes one very suspensful scene where the terrorists are in a van on the highway shooting machine guns at Ryan's wife's Porsche. That should make you want to watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good thriller, Tom Clancy style.

57,"This set consists of 40 short films and series photographs shot between 1894 and 1913. Arranged in roughly chronological order, with the earlier pieces subdivided into categories (""Edison Kinetoscopes,"" ""Lumiere Films,"" ""Actualities""), they present an overview of the early silent era of motion pictures. Most people have seen stills or excerpts from such films as ""A Voyage to the Moon"" and ""The Great Train Robbery,"" but seldom have people had the chance to experience such pioneering works in their entirety. This is not a disc for everybody. Only those who have a keen interest in the development of motion pictures at their earliest phase will appreciate it. If you are one of those, like me, consider this a must buy. 
 
 In addition to scripted comedies and dramas, there are a number of films that simply record everyday life at the turn of the last century. There is ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"", which is said to have panicked early audiences who failed to grasp that the approaching train wasn't going to come through the screen and run them over. Other films, such as ""Snowball Fight"" and ""Seminary Girls"" are staged with the intent of creating the appearance of spontaneity. Either way, these rarely seen films are important documents of a recent past that is so different from our present that it's hard to believe that they were shot only a century ago. 
 
 The Dolby Digital mono sound is clear and well presented. Many of the films are tastefully scored with newly recorded piano music, while others are paired with period recordings. ""Skyscrapers of New York City From North River,"" for example, is particularly haunting when viewed with its mysterious, unidentified musical accompaniment drifting from the speakers. A good number of films in this collection date back to the 1890's, and a lot of them are a lot better looking than I would have thought. Some films, like Train Robbery, even have their original hand painted color tints intact. One of the neat things about the DVD is the freeze frame, because I was able to spot a single frame in one of the Kinetiscope films that was slipped in to read ""Copyright 1907 T.A. Edison."" This is not a disc that's about features, other than being able to zip from film to film versus fast forwarding on VHS, nor is it one to show off your home theatre. This is a film for those with a serious interest film history only

Children don't easily identify with planets, since they are spheres that cannot be seen in their daily lives. Children usually respond to the colors, but never really connect with them. Now, with ""My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets"" the planets all have faces, personalities, and the undivided attention of my class. The show transforms the planets into memorable characters. It really has helped my students to remember not only the names of the planets, but also detailed facts about them. I have recommended this DVD to our school district, for I feel that it should be part of the regular curriculum. The DVD is so wonderful that it can be enjoyed outside the classroom as well and give children a real head-start on learning the planets and developing a passion for astronomy.

Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch ""Clueless"" and ""The Craft"" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.

65,"""The Searchers"" is considered by many to be a masterpiece of both the Western genre and of movies in general. It's even on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#96). I liked the film; It's got a lot of good things about it, but one thing I look for in a film to really call it ""Great"" is entertainment. The movie is entertaining, but a movie on that same list that's a few notches below it ('Unforgiven') was a much better movie; Both as a film and as entertainment. Anyway, I've seen over a thousand movies and have somehow never seen a John Wayne film. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier who shacks up with his brother and his family. After they're all killed and his two nieces are kidnapped, Ethan sets out on an obsessive quest to get them back. One of the nieces is found dead soon after and the rest of the film is about them trying to find the living one Debbie (Natalie Wood). Along with him is Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter), a man Ethan doesn't really like. Ethan hates indians and Martin is 1/8 Comanche. Early in the film, you find out that Ethan actualyl saved Martin when his family was killed by indians and gave him to his brother and his brother's wife. Even though he seems disagreeable, it sounds like Ethan's quest in honorable enough. But, you'd be wrong. He's not out to save Debbie, but to kill her. When people are kidnapped by the indians, they pretty much become one...And Ethan can't have that. The movie takes place over a long time span and there were times that, I thought, the movie seemed longer than it was. The film has beautiful cinematography though, especially when you consider that the film was released in 1956. John Wayne's performance is very good and, you find later, multilayered. Having read about the film a little bit, I found that it inspired movies like Taxi Driver and even the Buddy Holly song
 ""That'll Be the Day"" (which is a line Ethan frequently says). I should make this clear that I'm not a huge fan of classic westerns, so that may have something to do with my view of the film. I know that certainly not everyone will agree with me about it. But I can say this. If you're a big fan of Westerns and/or John Wayne. You'll probably like this movie.

68,"The original DVD release of ""Howards End"" was the no-frills which probably was fine with everyone who has a tight-budget on DVD collection.  However, after watching this version has totally changed my mind about Criterion DVD editions.  Now, the picture is crisp and sharper compared to the grainy texture of the original transfer.  The scene of Leonard Bast's stroll in the meadows of bluebells was so much more dream-like with the magnificent violet and green colors on the screen.  Also, the music seems to surround all around you compared to the original release which seemed almost like watching on the TV with speakers in your face.  You really have to appreciate that such a film gets the attention for being placed on Criterion release.  Actually, this is released through HVE which is pretty much sister company of Criterion.
 
 Anyways, the film itself is probably the best production of the Merchant-Ivory team.  Its beauty is in its storytelling of the Wilcox and Schlegel families with the best performace from Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.  The supporting cast is equally good with Helena Bonham-Carter and Vanessa Redgrave.  You probably will get the most satisfication from viewing the second disc.  It has several commentaries from James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter tells her hardships with some scenes such as the row boat with the hidden roaring motor and also the rainy return home from a music recital with some trouble from the umbrella.  It was also interesting to listen from the production team about the transformation of London into the Edwardian period with the scenes and clothing/fashion.
 
 Overall, this Criterion DVD edition is worth every penny if you are a fan of filmmaking.  You definitely appreciate the efforts and dedication of Merchant and Ivory to fund and make such a film.  I really can't regret this purchase since many times, films don't get the royal treatment of Criterion.  Oscar-worthy movies are usually quickly released to the masses rather than being tailored for those with higher standards for the DVD viewing experience

69,"Attempting difficult poses, even modified versions, is a sure-fire way to discourage beginners from the practice, or make them feel inadequate, which is not what Yoga should cultivate. Even as an intermediate yoga practicioner, I did not like this tape, primarily because it throws you into the difficult poses without first generating sufficient heat in the body. The warm-up poses are minimal, static, and do not prepare your body sufficiently for the extensions and compressions of the advanced postures that follow. Besides all that, the instruction goes from excrutiating detail to not enough information (you have to break concentration and look to see what's going on) in the course of a single series of poses. Very frustrating. As if that weren't bad enough, the instructor's amazing flexibility is about the only inspiring aspect of the tape; her monotone delivery and the spare studio setting with no students make for a no fun experience

 War, really people, what is it good for?
 
 Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film ""Hart's War"", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his ""luxury"" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape. 
 
 Did I hint towards ""The Great Escape"" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes ""Hart's War"" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, ""You can't handle the truth"", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.
 
 How bland.  
 
 ""Hart's War"" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?  
 
 Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, ""oh brother!"".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.  
 
 This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved ""Fallen"" so very much.  ""Hart's War"" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.      
 
 So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?
 
 To my reply ... absolutely nothing. 
 
  I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give ""Hart's War"" a

71,"For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.
 
 This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).  
 Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.  
 
 Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision

The one with Billy Crystal is pretty funny too. In Harry's real life I got a kick out of Cookie the goodhearted prostitute.

79,"Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' ""exploitation"" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.
 
 Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time. 
 
 Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to ""grow"" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.
 
 Mission accomplished.
 
 Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.
 
 Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.
 
 Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.
 
 The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a ""meandering, almost formless script.""
 
 Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the ""story.""  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.
 
 All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the ""tragic"" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.
 
 However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.
 
 How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)
 
 I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an ""inside story"" on the making of this film:
 
 We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.
 
 Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a ""class assignment.""  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.
 
 There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).
 
 NEVER PAY for the ""chance"" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.
 
 Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.
 
 And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was ""originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries,"" but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.
 
 Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.
 
 But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see.

Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.

The movie was set in a mall, but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival, NO! I read an interview with the Director of this movie, and when asked about setting the movie in a mall, the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine.  Now look, when you're using the title, ""Dawn of the Dead"", you better remake it great, I mean really great.  The followers of Romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the GP.  You know, I might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different.  Definately not when the same.  If you want to see really good Zombie movies, watch the original Romero trilogy, 28 Days Later, the Lucio Fulci trilogy, or even the Return of the Living Dead.

86,"When Tru Calling's pilot started I originally thought, ""well, this show will be cancelled soon"". it was messy, unoriginal & kinda lame. but that's how it was supposed to start. then the 2nd episode was more believable & was a little better in every area that Pilot lacked! & from then to the middle of the season, it had its high points & its lows, Closure being one of my fav episodes! then, enter Jason Priestley as Jack, I'm thinking, why on Earth is he on this show? they must be desperate or something. but his character suddenly started making the show more interesting, things started moving faster & the show became darker, there were more things going on in the episodes & by the finale, Tru Calling hit its high point! everything was looking good for the show! but had they started out that good, maybe Fox would've gave it a better promotion. One of my fav moments is in Death Becomes Her when Jack saves Harrison's car by calling the thief's bluff. & from that moment, you have to know there's something up with Jack. especially after the audience presumably found out that he got a girl to commit suicide by making a phone call to her parents telling them about her constant gambling. & then with some help from Tru, Davis has to re-find out what he did on day one & tell her that Jack also relives days which in the next episode we find out why. He's there to stop her! & after getting Luc(Mat Bomber) killed, he takes a vacation & hopes that Tru will stop saving lives that are suppose to die. but Tru doesn't give up & when Jack comes back, things start getting tricky.
 
 Perfect Storm- 5/5 Jack's return makes it difficult for her to save the life of a cop who died in a white squal but Jack sending her back out in the water at night makes it even harder after Davis saved her the first time by making a ""phony"" phone call. & Davis gets a replacement psychiatrist & things don't go so well with her.
 
 Grace- 5/5 Jack sets Tru up for murder & things hit rock-bottom before they get better for her.
 
 In the Dark- 4/5 In one of the more obvious deaths for the viewers anyway, Tru is forced to figure out who died after a party is thrown by her brother at the morgue. Jack keeps Tru on her feet & makes her go on a wild goose chase.
 
 The Last Good Day- 5/5 My fav episode of Tru Calling. Everything changes when Jack gets asked for help from a girl who commited suicide. now the only question was, why? & why does the relive day feel so cold to Tru?
 
 Enough- 5/5 Tru crosses the line when she tries to save life of her boyfriend Jensen as Jack tries to stop her & even Davis warns her of the reprecussions of saving the life of someone who doesn't ask for her help. She shouldn't be able to choose, it's up to fate. but she doesn't listen & something severe does happen in return.
 
 Twas the Night Before Xmas, Again- 4/5 Harrison finds out about his dad's alliance with Jack but before he warn Tru, her day restarts. Tru reluctantly lets Jack help her in solving a murder case possibly after an old cadaver asks for help. 
 
 It's an ok ending cause it at least it isn't a cliff hanger but it's a shame it didn't get a whole season & stupid shows that shouldn't be around cause their just getting stupid(cough*the oc*cough) are still on??? but Fox screwed Tru Calling, see my review for the first season for more about how ticked off I am at fox, lol.
 
 plus some features on the show & I think anyone should get into this show! the second season could've been so great had they had a whole season! these six episodes are worth your money just the same! a memorable show too bad it wasn't given a real chance cause it did become something great!

88,"Biggest piece of pretentious (...) I've seen in a long long time!!!
 
 It's all very autobiographical about this really ""cool"" and ""talented"" actress Anna Battista who is adored by her public and so wants to get into directing. Daria Nicolodi plays Anna's mother. (Who else?) And Asia is shown as nude as can be involved in a handful of sex scenes that are at times bordering on the harder side of softcore (all of course in the interest of ""honesty""). And that's about the only good thing that can be said about the movie.
 
 The film just screams ""Me! Me! Me!"" Pity that not everyone who is director, writer and actor in one is automatically an Orson Welles. Prior to the start we even have a clip of Asia advising us that we probably heard already how bad the film is, but that it REALLY is very good (shouldn't that be up to the viewer to decide???) and that it had saved her life blah blah.
 
 This movie has - hands on stomach - some of most pathetic and amateurish performances I have seen in quite some time. It so wants to be arty, hip and experimental and is even shot in three different languages: English, Italian and French. I would have actually preferred if the English parts had also been subtitled as I really haven't got a clue what Ms Argento was mumbling most of the time. In actual fact this ended up being the first DVD where I completely gave up on following the director's commentary: I had to really crank up the sound on it, and still found it hard to hear what she had to say (contentwise: very little anyway). For someone who is supposed to be such an expressive actress, Asia simply has the most boring, dull and expressionless voice I have ever heard recorded. 
 
 I was never the biggest Asia Argento fan, but after watching this flick my respect for her dropped to new lows. This lady has one of the biggest Egos in the biz, with unfortunately very little talent or trace of humour to boost and is an utter moron full of pseudo-intellectual pretensions.

91,"Here are some interesting facts relating to ""Heat"" and myself:
 
 LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes
 NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231
 NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0
 NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0
 NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6 
 
 Truth be told, I've never actually watched ""Heat"" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really ""Heat""s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)
 
 And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film ""Adaptation"", and though it didn't specifically refer to ""Heat"" it totally applies.  On a related note, ""The 3"" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than ""Heat"", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out ""Adaptation"".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)   
 
 Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think ""Heat"" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years ""Heat"" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.
 
 But til then, the hell with ""Heat"".  I'll just watch ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Departed"" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than ""Heat"".

92,"I'll be right up front and admit that I do not own this DVD. I hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact. But then I realized that if you're reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.
 
 Frankly, the movie barely approaches a ""B-Movie"" status. It's only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.
 
 The plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.
 
 One glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn't advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.
 
 To its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.
 
 It was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.
 
 If you're a collector of good film, this really wouldn't be part of your collection. To add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships, it would be very appropriate. Sadly, it really is good for only that one reason, as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years

93,"I'm really tired of the shoddy DVD manufacturing used by many studios and distributors.
 
 This is a great film.  I have it on tape.  I was thrilled to see it'd been released on DVD.  I love Italian knock-offs of American films (STREET LAW seems inspired by DEATH WISH), and I'm a Barbara Bach fan.
 
 So I bought this STREET LAW DVD brand new, as soon as Amazon offered it, without waiting for the price to go down.  I unwrap the pristine-looking DVDm pop it into the player, and after a few minutes it pauses.
 
 Then it pauses again.  It pauses constantly throughout the film.  I mean at least once a minute, often several times a minute.  Pause, pause, pause.  Most of the pauses are brief, some last several seconds.  I eventually took out the DVD, cleaned it, but it didn't help.  I suffered through 50 minutes of this film, then gave up.
 
 VHS was a decent format.  Tape had problems, but nowhere near as bad as DVD, with all the skipping and scratching.  (And Google ""DVD rot"" -- see what comes up.)  
 
 Still, changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we'd already bought, so I guess it makes sense for them.

94,"I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about ""historical"" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no ""ugly"" shot in either ""Ran"" or ""Kag"" - merely that there are more ""authentically Japanese"" films out there to choose from.

95,"there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable ""crash"", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst ""mainstream"" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek

96,"Continuing the high standard set by the quality of episodes from the third season, season 4 of Star Trek: The Next Generation maintains a high standard throughout. The conclusion of the previous season's cliff-hanger ""The Best of Both Worlds"" does not disappoint, it's the rollercoaster finish we were all hoping for. It doesn't end there though, the writers were brave enough to not have the next episode be ""back to normal"" as Star Trek is so good at doing but write a real character episode ""Family"" mainly dealing with Picard's trauma after being assimilated by the Borg.
 There aren't any terrible episodes this season, Qpid is a bit silly with the crew as Robin Hood characters - most of the stories are strong. ""Future Imperfect"" continues the brinkmanship between the Federation and the Romulans (with Andreas Katsulas of Babylon 5 fame and Riker telling Picard to ""shut up""), ""Data's day"" is an entire episode from Data's perspective, ""The Wounded"" introduces us to the Cardassians, ""First Contact"" is what Star Trek's all about, then we get into ""The Mind's Eye"" and ""Redemption"" where the Romulan, Klingon and Federation triangle plot finally starts to come out.

97,"Very few sequels live up to their famous firsts, even though Spiderman 2 and Shrek 2 recently shattered this premise.  This is another in that rare grouping, running at an entertaining 12 minutes longer than the first.
 
 This time we learn of the existence of a whole network of Spy Kids, and Carmen and Juni have to prove their mettle against a well heeled sister and brother duo from hell.
 
 Their adventures take them to a mysterious island, invisible to radar, where ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" meets ""Sinbad"", ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Fantasy Island"".  Star turns by Ricardo Montalban as Carmen and Juni's grandfather, and Steve Buscemi as the nutty scientist, as well as cameos by Alan Cumming and Tony Shaloub increase the entertainment value fourfold.
 
 The rival Spy Kids dialogue and superciliousness go against the grain sometimes, but the gadgetry is as brilliant as the first, even though they don't always work when needed.  
 
 Imagination rules here, and if you like those old adventure movies with fantastic creatures and swashbuckling heroes, you will like this one.  Better yet, adults can enjoy it without needing the excuse of having a child.

98,"What can I say about the truly inspired film ""Havoc"" that hasn't been said before?  Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award winning documentarian, taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture--sounds like a recipe for success!  Add a talented cast of appealing up-and-coming actors given really meaty roles--awesome!
 
 Not so much...
 
 ""Havoc"" is, unfortuanately, an unmitigated disaster.  You won't believe your eyes.  The kids, the gangs, the streets of L.A.--everything just rings so false.  The last time I saw so many posers ""playing"" street toughs was at my Junior High auditions for ""Grease"".  And I think we could have taken these kids.
 
 A lot has been made about the ""shocking"" sexual content of the film.  Anyone ""shocked"" by this movie probably doesn't see very many movies.  Anne Hathaway does appear naked, which seems to be a selling point, but she and everyone else deserves better.
 
 I'd actually have rated the movie about a 4--because it's a campy mess!!!  If someone had realized that this was a B-level exploitation flick, and sold it as such--I'd have bought into it.  No, though.  This is a ""serious movie"" and ""important"" document of our time.  Sadly, on that scale, these kids need to go back to school because they failed

99,"I like this film because several reasons, unlike most of the National Lampoon's I've recently seen, this was the least silly & disgusting. there was a better plot to it, Paris Hilton is a fine actor! alot of people would say she's playing herself in this movie but if u think that, then u don't really know her. but I'm not getting into that. now to the plot, Veronica(Hilton) is the hottest girl in the school, popular, dating the ""hottest"" guy on campus & is totally rich! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for FHM, she needs the hottest girls to compete with her. only that doesn't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate. there is a journey of self-discovery, lessons to be learned but it's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere. lots of this doesn't make sense but who cares. it's a very cheesy flick but it has humor, nudity, all the things u'd want from a National Lampoon's flick & I give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film! I say it's a good film to see, though maybe not a family film, it's still worth your time!

 The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES.

105,"With 21st century eyes, it's wonderful to see a family like the Waltons. Although they are scrabbling against poverty, living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during the Depression, they are happy. The large family, which includes seven children, parents, and grandparents, is loving and supportive. Sure, the kids aren't angels -- like any others, they squabble and have their problems. But when push comes to shove, they've got one another's backs, like when eldest sister Mary Ellen beats up a classmate for mocking little brother Jim Bob's shirt (made from sister Erin's old dress) or when eldest brother John-Boy defends Mary Ellen from a potential assault by a guest staying with the family.
 
 Most gratifying is the children's overall contentment. Sure, they aspire for ""things"" - they long to see a traveling circus that comes to the mountains, and they pause by toys displayed in the general store. But for the most part, they don't dwell upon what they don't have. They take contentment in life in general, and when the occasional treat comes their way, they truly appreciate it...unlike many kids today, whose parents buy them the latest iPods and video games, and it's STILL not enough. 
 
 The Waltons' saga is told through the eyes of eldest son John-Boy, who is 17 and aspires to be a writer. He is based on Earl Hamner, a Virginia native who wrote ""Spencer's Mountain,"" the book upon which the show is based. Hamner does a voiceover in each episode, speaking as the adult John-Boy looking back on his childhood.
 
 (For the record, I'm 26 years old, not someone who grew up with this show, or looks down upon ""today's youth"" from the vantage of age. But, as you know, not all young folks are content with the attitudes of today's society as a rule. I, for one, truly wish we could return to a simpler time; it won't be long before our complicated lives lead us to self-destruct.

108,"This supposed 'language lab' is VERY poorly designed. The dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language. The amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken! It might as well be completely random sounds, since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context. While I understand that supposedly this DVD is only intended to 'stimulate' the brain, by six months, a baby's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language, and to selectively ignore others. The brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home, thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid. A baby's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language. Habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again. Imagine if the baby's brain gave equal attention to any sound--the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers. We acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective. 
 
 Babies depend heavily on repitition, adult modeling, observing cause and effect, and from watching other people's behaviors to learn language. The idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly. If you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home, try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis, or show him programs like Dora or Sesame Street, where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning, clear annunciation, and repition.

109,"I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!

110,"We bought this installment of the ""Disney Treasures"" series when it was released late in 2005.  My 9 year old son and I just watched these cartoons again (Oct. 2006) and we both love them.  I would have to agree, however, with those reviewers who have noted that visually the cartoons in this Vol. 2 of the ""Chronological Donald"" were not restored to the same degree of perfection as those in earlier releases, including Vol. 1 of the ""Chronological Donald"" and the release containing many Donald World War II cartoons entitled ""On the Front Lines"".  There is a clear difference in quality, which is apparent when the Donald cartoons previously released in ""On the Front Lines"" and repeated in this collection are compared to the cartoons that are new here.  The former are visually superior, not because they were better to begin with, but because they have been more carefully restored and transferred.  This is a shame.  One hopes that in Chronological Donald Vol 3 (apparently not to be released in 2006, but perhaps in 2007) there will be a return to the quality of Vol. 1 and ""On the Front Lines.""  One might even hope for a new, improved Vol. 2, but that is probably not in the cards

111,"Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.
 
 The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This ""problem"" became an asset later.
 
 The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.
 
 It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.
 
 In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.
 
 Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
 
 All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.
 
 If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this

112,"After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.  
 
 I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to ""Kingdom Come"" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.  
 
 The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.

113,"I thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting, with a budget probably no bigger than an average Jackie Chan movie. The ending was novel and Jet Li&#8217;s use of needles, to supplement his martial arts skills, added a fresh touch.
 
 Jet Li looks convincing, with respect to his characterisation. And Bridget Fonda looks good too.

115,"When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?
 
 I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.
 
 But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.
 
 Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?
 
 I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.

116,"Without a doubt, Johnny Weissmuller's interpretation of Tarzan is the best of all! An excellent swimmer, Johnny Weissmuller makes the swimming scenes seem effortless and believable. Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane provides elegance, as a gentle yet brave and courageous woman, who falls in love with a man, king of the jungle, and yet completely unaware of civilization. The house Tarzan builds for her is a marvel of progress, with the latest technological advancements... in a rudimentary... simple... basic construction. When Edgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan he played on our survival instincts, and surfaced the innate fears of confronting savage beasts, and yet, the fantasy that we can become friends with all jungle creatures. 
 
 Tarzan and His Mate
 - Simply best in class. It explores how life should have been for Adam & Eve... in love, living in paradise, respecting nature, and living in complete harmony with the environment. Not spoiling and accepting the simple things offered by our planet Earth. 
 
 
 Tarzan Escapes
 - From civilization, Jane's cousins visit the Mutia Escarpment, only to realize that she has found true love, family, and home in Africa. The marvel of the home created by Tarzan is highlighted, with the elephant-powered elevator becoming a fascinating process to watch.
 
 Tarzan Finds a Son!
 - Here we meet a new addition to the family, played by Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Both Tarzan and Jane now have a play pal, and he does a magnificent job at allowing the audience to see how we can grow up in this environment and learn survival skills that keep him active, healthy, and self-assured. Great for a younger audience, adding fun and adventure to this wonderful set.
 
 Tarzan's New York Adventure
 One of the best scenes ever filmed is when Johnny Weissmuller dives off the Washington bridge, and makes it all look possible, doable... and easy. What precision! This movie is fun and Cheetah provides many a laugh. The struggle between good and evil are played to perfection in this series, where those in search for profit and wealth, are always trying to take advantage of the many natural treasures that surround Tarzan's simple life, and it is rewarding to see how the hero never gives in to avarice, defending and maintaining his world in its natural state. 
 
 We loved the set... and when we visit the zoo... or go to the Circus... we find ourselves looking at elephants and monkeys and saying... ""Simba... ungawa!"" ""Simba... ungawa!"" Would highly recommend acquiring this set

122,"This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. 
 
 ""Eight Women"" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. ""Eight Women"" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.
 
 Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.
 
 By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.

123,"The only E. L. Doctorow book I ever read was ""Ragtime,"" and I read it because I enjoyed Milos Foreman's film version. I wasn't impressed with the novel. The author's writing style was excruciating--on purpose or unintentional, I don't know--in a way that reminds one of Theodore Dreiser. Moreover, I continually found myself sighing heavily over the book's anachronisms. Sorry, but the early twentieth century WAS NOT the 1960s! Quit trying to rewrite history! Doctorow did do a few things right, however. His characters, at least a few of them, were interesting. Too, I liked how he integrated their tales with real life historical figures and events. So when I recently learned that Foreman's version of the book came out on DVD, I decided to rewatch the film. The director, who made ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1975, went on to lens several other memorable films, including ""Amadeus,"" ""The People vs. Larry Flynt,"" and ""Man on the Moon."" If you're familiar with any of these movies, it's obvious Milos Foreman likes using his camera to document kooky characters. ""Ragtime"" provides him with plenty of opportunities to examine oddball personalities engaging in often oddball behavior. Those crazy Gilded Age Americans!
 
 Several major and minor stories wend their way through ""Ragtime."" We follow a well to do New York family--consisting of ""Father"" (James Olson), ""Mother"" (Mary Steenburgen), and Mother's ""Younger Brother"" (Brad Dourif)--that seems to represent the WASP majority. The family becomes embroiled in a pregnancy scandal involving a black woman named Sarah (Debbie Allen) and her lover Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Howard E. Rollins Jr.). While Walker attempts to ingratiate himself with our WASP family in an effort to win over Sarah, he becomes involved in a minor scandal when a group of firemen led by Willie Conklin (Kenneth McMillan) vandalizes his automobile. Other threads focus on a poor Jewish artist named Tateh (Mandy Patinkin), whose invention of a nifty little gimcrack called ""picture books"" leads to a career as one of Hollywood's first film directors. A notorious murder case also takes center stage from time to time. When renowned architect Stanford White (Norman Mailer) starts fooling around with airheaded Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), her jealous lover Harry K. Thaw (Robert Joy) pops a couple of caps in White's noggin--in full view of hundreds of witnesses. As you can see, ""Ragtime"" covers an enormous amount of material.
 
 Remarkably, the movie works quite well. The first part spends all of its time establishing the story lines and fleshing out the characters. The second part focuses largely on Coalhouse Walker's failures to achieve justice for the wrongs done to him. He eventually turns into a terrorist who, with the help of a few friends, bombs several firehouses around town. Then he seizes a library in New York City, wires it with explosives, and threatens to blow the place sky high if he doesn't receive a new car to replace the damaged vehicle. Let's see--what else happens? Well, Younger Brother strikes up an affair with Evelyn Nesbit only to discover she's a total ditz that flits from man to man in search of easy money. Disenchanted with his failed relationship, Younger Brother falls in with decidedly unwholesome elements that--surprise--play a big part in the film's most important segment. Mother and Father drift apart over a number of issues, not the least of which involves Sarah's baby but also Father's stuffiness when it comes to progressive issues like feminism and race. Booker T. Washington (Moses Gunn) and Harry Houdini (Jeffrey DeMunn) also pop in from time to time, although the former plays a bigger part in the proceedings.
 
 Man, is this a tough film to summarize! Foreman and company pack a ton of stuff in two and a half hours and still fail to incorporate everything Doctorow put in his book. Oh well. Only a television miniseries could hope to achieve a faithful adaptation, and even then it wouldn't work considering the very adult material Doctorow placed in certain segments of his story. I think the best way to view the film is as a well-done period piece populated with a stellar cast. The costumes and the set pieces look great, from the glittery buildings populated by the elites to the dirty tenement houses where Tateh plies his trade. Performances are sublime. Watching Jimmy Cagney play a tough as nails police commissioner is wonderful, especially when you consider he hadn't appeared in a movie since 1961. Donald O'Connor, Pat O'Brien, Jeff Daniels, and even Jack Nicholson turn up as well in smaller roles. The late Kenneth McMillan, a personal favorite of mine, deserves special mention for playing a racist scumbag that you'll love to hate. Throw in an amazing score from none other than Randy Newman, and the result is an extremely entertaining film that holds your attention for 155 minutes.
 
 Extras on the disc include a commentary track with Milos Foreman and producer Michael Houseman, a lengthy deleted scene involving McGovern's character meeting anarchist Emma Goldman, and a featurette on the making of the film. My only real problem with ""Ragtime"" the motion picture concerns the anachronistic attitudes on race. I highly doubt the police would take the word of a black man over a white firefighter back in the 1910s, nor would there be as much sympathy as there is for Sarah's plight. That's the 1960s talking. Anyway, the film is a winner for the reasons I stated above. I also should mention that any movie that shows all around jerk and agitator Norman Mailer taking a bullet in the head gets my vote any day!

  The voice actors behind the talented cast here are some from the finest films in Japanese Anime...thats right...you might notice some from Ninja Scroll...Project A-Ko...and MORE...These voice actors bring that comprehensive hilarity to the screen....Yes, sorry if i sound like a washed up editoral hack...but bare with me...
 For instance... When the men tease Fong about him following his mother around...its just random and so damn funny. And the main bad guy, is great...he's a frstrated bully of a character who at times wont relent at insulting Fong about his closeness to his mom.
 
  And speaking of which , Fong and his ""legendary"" mom are one funny duo. And so is the man who sorta looks after Fong, who was the mothers ex lover i think. He has a funny deep serious voice.
 
 The action looks like it inspires the great anime films...thats right...not inspired by the anime...it seems like it would INSPIRE the anime world itself...It doesnt draw influence from great anime, but i bet films like this inspire japanese artists to create great anime series and stories!
 
  You might not understand all this, but its a different take , a unique review of the film that no one has noticed yet on amazon, for this film anyways.
 
  Sure, this english dub, American version of the film isnt true to the original...But i remember seeing this on tv...and it was even more edited than this im sure...and it was awesome...i taped it...but lost it i think, but now i finally have it, in its entirity.
 
  This film embodies a lot of what makes Kung Fu films so loveable and great. HUMOROUS CHARACTERS, AWESOME ACTION, INSPRING STYLIZATION.
 
 The scene where Fong walks slowly into battle as the colorfull pedals or leaves fall and float down from the sky is just beautifull and has power,cinematographically.....if thats a word, hahaha.
 
  This is a classic...it melds together serious inspiring action and laugh out loud hilarity.
 
  And i havent even seen the first movie yet.
 
 Hope this helped ya out in deciding if you wanna get this movie or not. Its not too expensive...when you buy it, just dont expect some oscar winning film...it aint...its not the greatest film ever produced...
 IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE.

126,"Not to be confused with `The Hunted' (2003) directed by William Friedkin.
 
 `The Hunted' (1995) stars French actor Christopher Lambert as Paul Racine, American businessman on trip to modern-day Nagoya, third-largest city of Japan, who happens to witness the killing of a woman by black-masked ninjas. The cult ninja group is actually led by a charismatic leader, Japanese named `Kinjo' who is played by a Chinese actor John Lone, and they begin to search Paul to kill. At the end of the film Paul, an ordinary businessman, proves to be an equal match when fighting against martial arts master Kinjo with a Japanese sword. If you can believe this ridiculous story, you can believe anything.
 
 I can happily ignore all the cultural inaccuracy in films as long as they give me something entertaining, but unfortunately it was not the case with `The Hunted,' of which story slowly follows a beaten path of the genre to the unexciting climax. Moreover, to handle a Japanese sword you need certain kind of gracefulness, which Tom Cruise in `The Last Samurai' managed to acquire after many months' hard training. Lambert et al. show no such thing. He and other ninjas just use them fast and furious, but with no grace and consequently, impact at all. Instead the film substituted the grace of Japanese sword fighting for needless bloody violence, and its pinnacle is the pointless terrorism of the ninjas in the bullet train. This is an insult to Japanese culture, for a ninja could be a spy or an assassin, but he is never a terrorist who would kill innocent passengers.
 
 But the most damaging is the way how the film treats women, who are there to be used for sex scenes. Watching Joan Chen in a Japanese bathtub with Christopher Lambert was something I never expected to see, and it surely represents the attitudes of some (if not all) Hollywood films towards women. And it is not surprising to see the film's director is J. F. Lawton, whose biggest hit is Julia Roberts' `Pretty Woman' (as a writer).
 
 By some distributors (who must have been shocked to know the film's awful content after buying the right) really released this Universal film theatrically in Japan. Since then it has been a cult film for avid Japanese film fans, who take this film as sort of comedy. Really. In addition to the ridiculous casting and the laughable scene where Chris and Joan make love in Japanese bathtub that looks as if made 200 years ago, it has plenty of things that make us laugh - a sweet little girl in pachinko parlor, a kind of gambling place (What is she doing there?); a flight attendant-like female assassin in the bullet train (Come on, it's a train, not an airplane!), and the banging Japanese taiko (drum) concert in the garden of a Nagoya hotel (You just cannot sleep!). Even though this is an action flick, it needs some degree of plausibility, which it totally disregards. And there are poorly done actions, which is another reason that makes me regard `The Hunted' as the Universal Pictures have temporarily stepped into the Ed Wood's Grade-Z territory

127,"It's hard to imagine this was Sam Raimi's first entry into films, considering his more tame offerings such as Spider-Man, which is a good movie by the way, even if it doesn't feature any gore.
 
 Are you looking for a bath of gory fun? This is the movie that MUST be in your collection if you are a blood hound like myself. Ash is at his weakest in this version of the series, but this is how he gets started. The cast is much different than that of Evil Dead 2, and by far, this film is MUCH gorier, as preferred. How gory? How about spilling buckets of blood, bodily dismemberment and loads of gut chopping. Wonderful horror film without any limitations on the gore. And I thought Braindead was gory, ha

128,"The main theme of this film is well known and very well worked out.  Two enemies meet in a neutral surrounding.  They want to kill each other, but by one reason or another, they don't.  Sounds familiar?  Well here we have an extra twist - a woman.  None of these three people understand each other; they speak different languages and they have different backgrounds.  There is no understanding but yet there is some.  They feel each other.
 
 The film is smartly complemented by the excellent director's work, superb acting, top cinematography, and the beautiful scenery of (Laplandia - Korelia) the northern Russia - southern Finland.  This was the territory the Soviets aggressively took away from the Finns in 1939 in the Soviet - Finish war (the forgotten war).  That is when the Finish snipers and the brutal winter destroyed the Soviet Army but still a little country as Finland could not defend itself against the Soviet might.
 
 I give this film five stars and a very warm recommendation to everyone to watch it.

129,"Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""Diabolique"" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.   
 
 Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.   
 
 ""Diabolique"" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, ""Diabolique"" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.

130,"Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman star in this great movie from the 80's about a girl from the Valley and a guy from Hollywood.  Foreman stars as Julie, a valley girl who, along with her boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen) are the most popular couple at Valley High.  However, Julie is getting bored with Tommy because she thinks he's ignoring her.  So, she breaks up with him (on a mall escalator, no less).  After the break-up, Julie and her friends Samantha (Tina Theberge), Loryn (Elizabeth Daily), and Suzie (Michelle Meyrink) head to the beach.  It is here that Julie gets her first glimpse of Randy (Cage).
 
 Unfortunately for Julie, she and her now ex-boyfriend Tommy are both supposed to go to a party at Suzie's house.  Randy's friend Fred overhears the plans for the party, and he and Randy plan to crash the party.  Sure enough, Fred and Randy show up uninvited at Suzie's house, but Julie is immediately intrigued by Randy.  The two start talking, but Tommy and his thug friends interfere and throw Randy out of the house.  Now very mad, Randy and Fred go back to the party.  Randy waits in the bathroom for Julie to come in, and the two decide to leave together.  Julie convinces Samantha to come along.
 
 Randy takes Julie ""over the hill' to Hollywood and shows her some of his favorite places to hang out.  The sparks soon begin to fly between Randy and Julie, and they start going steady, much to the disgust of Julie's friends.  Their relationship goes along very well for a while, but one night at a sleepover, Julie's friends tell her that she must make a choice between them and Randy.  They convince her to get back together with Tommy and dump Randy.   Julie goes along with it, and starts to be very mean to Randy, but does she really feel that way, or is she just covering up her true feelings for the sake of her friends?  Will Julie and Randy get back together, or will Julie do what her friends want her to?
 
 This is a great movie.  I've seen it several times on VHS, and I was thrilled to find it on DVD. Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman are great in their roles as Julie and Randy.  The supporting actors are very good as well.  This movie was released when I was in high school, so it brings back a lot of memories for me.  The great 80s music played throughout the movie is a huge plus, too.  
 
 I give this movie my highest recommendation. The story is excellent, and the acting is very good.  Take a trip back to the 80s with this great movie.  ""Its awesome""

131,"What do you do when you witness you boyfriend killing someone?  Go into witness protection at a convent.  Lounge singer Deloris becomes Sister Mary Clarence.  But when Sister Mary Clarence is Whoopi Goldberg expect a lot of attitude.
 
 Delores finds it hard adjusting to convent life.  That is until she gets her hands on the choir.  She turns a mediocre off key group into a hip ensemble.  This draws too much attention and her mobster boyfriend finds her.  This ends up in a wild chase by the Sisters through a Las Vegas casino.
 
 Maggie Smith is always a good choice for any role but she is wasted a bit as the Mother Superior.  The best supporting roles goes to the three sidekick nuns Mary Patrick, Mary Roberts, Mary Lazarus - Kathy Najimy, newcomer Wendy Makkena and the proverbial nun Mary Wickes (this is her third of four times as basically the same character and she ended her career as a gargoyle on Notre Dame.)

133,"The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.
 
 Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development.
 Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.
 
 It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable.

135,"I've taught this film in colleges for thirty-plus years.  Even back at the earliest screenings, traditional-aged freshmen had trouble with it (a) because it was in b&w, and (b) because the dimensional characters didn't telegraph plot advancement but instead used irony, wit, or assumptions that would later be proven wrong by subsequent events.  
 The first of these objections stunned me when they couldn't appreciate Gene Tierney descending the stairs to seduce ""Larry"" in a gown relegated to grays.  The second objection (young auduence confusion) just made me sad about the impact of television ... but you already know that story.
 As with Hollywood's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, released in during the same general period, I personally appreciate the ""epic scope"" of the narrative, enhanced by remarkable set direction detail.  And I appreciate even more the depth-of-focus photography in both of these films, which enriches viewing by sharp images at several planes of action within the frame.  It's a story well-told at the visual level.
 I've read complaints about Tyrone Power's ""dated"" acting in this performance, NIGHTMARE ALLEY, etc.  But again, I suspect this is from a generation more comfortable with MTV editing than with theatre as an entertainment criterion.  Power is given a series of difficult monologues to recite about uncinematic spiritual/ philosophical themes, and he pulls each off brilliantly.  As with Olivier's opening scene in RICHARD III, it's interesting to watch how these monologues have been directed to use a pacing movement of the actor within the frame as a ""paragraphing"" punctuation.  The lengthy, uninterrupted takes and consequent fluidity of camera movement within these shots not only enhances the impact of the monologues but also makes sly commentary on characters/ themes as continuous camera includes other characters in medium close-ups.
 Herbert Marshall's Maugham is interesting and underplayed almost as masterfully as Cedrick Hardwicke's performance of ""goodness personified"" in ROPE.  The close-ups of ""Maugham's"" eyes to communicate ironic plot points may seem obtrusive, but they're true to Maugham's voice in the novel.  
 Further, they emphasize the ill-advised decision to omit this narrator's perspective in Murray's hapless remake.  That later film fails in no small part because the female characters are virtually indistinguishable visually, and because the studio (which only made the film to entice Murray to make GHOSTBUSTERS II) invested no interest in producing a good movie script.  Pity, since Murray could have done okay.
 Two less successful scenes in the 40s version are the ""Baby!"" hospital melodrama and the ashram Jehovah sequences (not including the remarkably visual spiritual moment in the mountains).  But the supporting cast remains superb throughout--especially the bracing comedy of Webb and Lancaster, and the moving subtlety of John Payne and Lucille Watson.  
 Tierney's richest moments are linked to the plot:  ""That's all right, Larry.  It might be less than a year""; the wedding announcement over the phone; the camera-narrated scene where Isabel ""seduces"" Larry's fiancee; and, of course, the climax with Larry at the end.  And, by the way, she's as gorgeous as Tyrone Power!  
 How much more value can one expect from an entertainment that succeeds so well with complex, mature themes of spiritual redemption in a society of capitalist myopia?

 But it is his discovery of a Boiler Room operation hawking non-existent stocks and bonds for non-existent companies that really steers this movie.
 
 Fantastic interactions between the main character, and Vin Disel character.  I appreciated the relationship beteen Giovanni and the secretary character, but I felt it was under-developed and weak.  Could have been left out, or developed better.

137,"Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be?
 
 Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning ""To live""). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to ""live it up"" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor.
 
 Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, ""The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same."" Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy.
 
 The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its ""inner life."" Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado. 
 
 Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is ""The Mummy."" Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed.
 
 It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces.
 
 Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or ""Mr. K,"" as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar.
 
 The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews.  Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them.  There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to.  It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa.
 
 Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered ""too Western"" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this ""Mr. K"" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you ""hate"" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term ""timeless classic.

Second, it is important for parents to explore different possibilities for why students aren't performing. I have an 8 yr old nephew who was just diagnosed with severe dislexia and the original prescription was drugs for ADD. Explore the possibilities! Third, the specific story of the teenager drove home the importance of having smaller classes in high school. I have 35 kids in each class. I know that for some, that is small. I have 6 classes. It is impossible for teachers, most of us wish we could, to be able to cater to the needs of each individual student. The video showed the importance of not only giving a correct diagnosis for a students problems, but the importance of following through and working with the student, so he or she can really succeed. The real stories showed the emotion that not only the students go through, but the families as well. It is a firm reminder that children need understanding, not labels.

141,"After two somewhat experimental seasons, Seinfeld really began hitting its stride in this third season. It's really a tribute to the talent that was in front of and behind the cameras on this show that they tweaked the formula for two seasons until near perfect comedy and chemistry was achieved. 
 
 In ""The Library"" we see how the writers make everything come full circle in this show. One of the best one-episode characters in Seinfeld's history, the Library Detective is an hilariously stubborn old fashioned man who confronts Jerry about a missing book from 1971 that was never returned. Jerry goes to see his girlfriend at the time to see if he returned the book, only to find that he had not. Meanwhile, Kramer meets a pretty librarian and George sees his brown toothed underwear pulling gym teacher, who now is a bum living under the steps of the NYC Public Library. The old man hasn't changed much, and he gives George yet another wedgie.  Also, the library book turned out not to be just a red herring, as it turns out the homeless gym teacher has hung onto it all these years.
 
 ""The Red Dot"" is a hilarious example of how George cannot just leave well enough alone - he always has to push everything to its limits. Elaine gets the long out-of-work George a job at the publishing company for which she works. Everything would be back on track for George, but he just can't resist having sex in the office with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady takes the encounter more seriously than George does, and George is afraid she'll tell his boss of the encounter and get him fired. He decides to give her a gift, a cashmere sweater that has been deeply discounted because of a tiny red dot on it that is supposedly too small to see yet each of its recipients spot it almost immediately, including the cleaning lady. She informs on George, and he is out of work once again. 
 
 The season finale, ""The Keys"", sets up the Emmy winning fourth season. Kramer has been abusing his house priveleges in Jerry's apartment too much, so Jerry revokes his spare key privileges. Realizing that he has broken the ""covenant of the keys"" gives Kramer the realization he is now free to break out of his routine. Kramer takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor. Jerry gave his spare keys to Elaine, then when he needs them, he goes with George to Elaine's to search for his spare set, since George has Elaine's spare keys. What they find is Elaine's show-biz project, an episode of Murphy Brown that she has written. Elaine finds the two going through her stuff and in turn revokes George's spare key priveleges. Kramer finds adventure as he journeys across the country to LA where he gets a bit part on Murphy Brown playing her secretary. The next season picks up on the gang trying to locate Kramer in California.
 
 I highly recommend this season as the first season of Seinfeld where everything seems to be clicking both storywise and character-wise. It's not a show where you need any background from previous seasons, since, after all, it is ""a show about nothing"". However, I found it helpful to view the first two seasons first to see how everything came together

 The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care. 
 Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story.
 The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch.
 The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear.

In his younger years Dowd was a physics student at Columbia, and even worked on the atom bomb project (he was present at the Bikini Atoll tests), but his mother was an opera singer and perhaps he was destined for music. Dowd was a master technical innovator, musical aesthete, coach, father figure, and psychologist. He himself narrates most of the film, but we are also treated to original concert footage (Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, etc.) and retrospective interviews with a number of the stars whose sounds he perfected, including Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, and Greg Allman. The five minutes or so when Dowd sits at a console and walks us through the thirty-year-old master copy of ""Layla,"" starting with only the guitars and then adding the various parts until they pulse with that incredibly evocative sound that defined an era, interspersed with poignant reflections by Clapton, are worth the entire film. One disappoint in this otherwise fascinating glimpse of the history of music recording since the late 1940s is that we learn nothing at all personal about Dowd, and nothing at all about any weaknesses, failures, misjudgments, and the like, that would have made this entirely likable person even more richly human

147,"You can immediately feel that you are a part of history and even when you know their (Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera) story you still get surprised amused and amazed. I have seen their actual work and this film brings it back. For people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction. I found it interesting how Frida (Selma Hayek) and Diego (Alfred Molina) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them. 
 
 Also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of ""Water for chocolate"".  Many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate.  The colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film. I have only seen one other Julie Taymor directed film ""Oedipus Rex"" (1992) which also had this quality. Julie seems to know how to bring out thoughts that we do not know we have our selves and we see many things in a new way.
 
 I started to buy the soundtrack but do not see Lila Downs on any of the tracks. And her singing was the soul of the movie.
 
 Now it is time to read the Hayden Herrera (book) ""Frida - A Biography of Frida Kahlo"" to see how much is in this screen adaptation by Clancy Sigal.

148,"""Pet Sematary Two"" was directed by the same Mary Lambert who directed the original ""Pet Sematary"" and the similarities in style are clearly evident between the two movies.  Once again, Lambert paints a disturbingly dark and morbid picture in part two of this horror movie series.  
 
 Basically, the plot centers around a young boy played by Edward Furlong who is absolutely devastated by his mother's grisly demise...naturally, he would do anything to get his mother back and eventually does.  The basic premise behind this movie appears to be that the evil force behind the pet sematary is calling upon Furlong's character to resort to the pet sematary to bring back his mother along with some incredible evil as well.
 
 Overall, the movie works a good bit like the original and while it is certainly an entertaining enough movie for horror movie fans, the sequel is not nearly as effective as the original.  One strong area that the original ""Pet Sematary"" had was the very interesting character of Jud played very well by Fred Gwynne...Jud's character carries the momentum of each scene in the original and basically made ""Pet Sematary"" work, but we don't have that strong character presence to make the wheels go round in this sequel, therefore the movie comes across flat.  What we do have in this sequel is an average horror movie that attempts to cash in on the success of the original classic.  
 
 Perhaps, the characters in ""Pet Sematary II"" are just weak in general (no disrespect to Clancy Brown or Anthony Edwards), but something is missing here in part two of this series despite the similarities in the dark and disturbing atmosphere painted so meticulously by Lambert.  Quite frankly, I did not like the casting of Edward Furlong as the main character to begin with...I don't know but it just left a bad taste in my mouth about this movie...he's such an uncharasmatic dork and his hard to sympathize with, notwithstanding the obvious limitations of his acting abilities.  
 
 The bottom line is that due to the lack of quality characters present in ""Pet Sematary Two"", the sequel just isn't near as compelling as the original.  Because ""Pet Sematary Two"" isn't anywhere near as good, nor as emotionally compelling as the original classic.  Indeed, one is left to wonder if a sequel was a smart move here.  Still, with that being said, ""Pet Sematary Two"" is not a terrible movie and so I give it TWO STARS which means it's just fair or average, but I would be remiss if I did not say that I've certainly seen a lot worse...just check out some of my other reviews and see what I mean.

149,"I hate to part company with the other reviewers here, as well as the Amazon comments but this NOT a must have. 
 I am huge fan of New Order and Joy Division and think they are one of the most important modern western popular bands of the last, almost thirty years for all their well-known contributions to existentilism and furturism in alternative, independent rock. Basically inventing post-punk, being one of the inventors of the dance-music, electronica scene a decade before most other bands and accidentaly inventing ""goth"" music along the way.
  Not to mention being excellent musicians with a very artsy, deep and humorous sensitivity.
 
 But, because they are such a good band it is glarringly obvious that the ""rock video"" is nothing more than a corporate music business era chore that bands just have to do as part of the job.
 
 Film critic Rodger Ebert once said the rock video is ""empty.""
 
 Here, they aren't so much empty as New Order's music is so good, just pointless.
               I find myself almost angry that a beautiful song such as ""Ceremony"" would have such a terrible video like this(incidently, I do not know what the viewer below is talking about...there is no original version of the ""Ceremony"" video...just this thing). An aweful, unwatchable piece of useless garbage featuring a fellow walking around with a trashbag on his head. I guess that is a reference to the thought process of music video directors. Not sure what else it could be. I could only stomach 40 seconds of this filth. I'm afraid after listening to this tune for more than ten years, both Joy Division's and New Order's...the images in mine and in other musician's heads will have to do. Unwatchable. Trash.
 The new ""Tempation"" video....embarrasing.
 
 Watch their concert videos, go see them live or better yet, think for yourself.
 
 There are a few winners...""Confusion"" is a classic and a great video as well as little bit of music history.
 
 ""Perfect Kiss"" is cool but I've seen it enough and life is short.
 ""Touched By the Hand of God"" is very funny..but ..again..life is short.
 The only thing I hadn't seen before and actually kind of liked was the Gina Birch ""Crystal""..that was a slightly cool workday music industry bit. Not important art in anyway....but better than Franz Fernidad peeing on an art gallery wall like the Nazis used to do.
 
 Videos?
 
 As for the documentary on the other disc. This is much better but is almost 13 years old. There are some excellent Joy Division clips here. Why don't we have a full DVD of all the Joy Division footage in the world yet? You get many of the same videos on the other disc played in full again on THIS disco too..in case you're someone like me who hated them enough the first time.
 Some great stuff, a bit of live Joy Division, great early live versions of 'Blue Monday"", ""Tempation""..and yes..""Ceremony"".
 The interviews are great as New Order speaks like real musicians and their collaborators are an interesting bunch making up a lot of what urban nightlife music culture has been from the late seventies until today on both sides of the Atlantic.

152,"Somew movies just have 'values' and the original The Four Feathers is one of them.
 
 FEATHERS is set in England and the Sudan about ten years after the Mahdi killed General Gordon.  In fact, seeing Charlton Heston in Khartoum would be a good lead-in to 4 FEATHERS.The plot revolves around four friends, all young officers in the same regiment and all heirs to an aristocratic military tradition heavy on the memory of the Crimean War (see the original ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" film).
 
 Three men boldly go to the Sudan with General Kitchener's expedition.  One chickens out and resigns his commission, losing the woman he loves in the process.  To redeem himself, he goes to the Sudan on his own and must help his former comrades.
 
 The story is well-explained, well-paced and has great values of timing, editing, and direction.  The technicolor and the score are both excellent.  4 FEATHERS is a cut above other British productions of the period in terms of technical quality!
 
 FEATHERS also exemplifies the best values of the Victorian UK upper class-- belief in country, honor, loyalty, heroism, and sacrifice.
 
 The remake is a pathetic immitation of this original, which did not need a remake, now or ever!  A must-see and a great addition to any DVD collection

154,"After Romero's &quot;Dead--movies&quot; as well as &quot;Dead Alive&quot; and &quot;Bad Taste&quot; this movie is rotten.No real plot,and no characters with any depth.The director calls it art.This is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it's really good.We are told that there are 139 deaths, but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.Comic Books do better than this.I guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.The most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman's mouth.This mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.Italians seem to do better with crappy gore than Germans

155,"I've only watched the first six episodes so far, waiting for some in depth story to unfold with diverse characters... blah blah blah.
 
 Nothing but a simple story line with everything spelled out.  There's no complexity to it, no unfolding of the characters, no mystery of peeling through the layers of their lives.  All the episodes seem so long and dragged out but nothing different ever really happens.  Boy tries to save girl, boy gets beat up, boy does what he feels is right without thinking it through, no strategy, no thought to his actions.  It almost seems like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes.
 
 Another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil King Hamdo is such a whiny coward, but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects.  Somebody would have dethroned him by now, in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed, kill his guards, have him in there sights, and not only miss him, but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk.  The actions and reactions of this world are just to unrealistic.

 BMX and Jet Li did not fit together well. I think that Jet Li's part could almost have been anybody else. 
 The story also disapointed me. It did not seem right that a cop,(from Tiwan) and a thief got together to save the world. It didn't make sense.

 This is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy.

A passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory.  It quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late '70s and early '80s didn't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming. What should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it's theorists is to vote for a certain political party.

163,"John Huston's noir-thriller is also a heist movie.  When Doc (Sam Jaffe) gets out of prison, he has a plan for the big heist.  He needs financial backing and a crew to help him.  Dix (Sterling Hayden) is the muscle, Gus (James Whitmore) the driver, and Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is the financial backer.  
 
 Dix is an embittered man whose dream is to buy back the farm his family lost.  Doc is a cool customer, genial and intellectual, and always has a plan.  Emmerich has a sick wife at home and a hot blonde (Marilyn Monroe) at his cottage by the river.  However, crime doesn't pay and each person's vice is their undoing.  
 
 This is a fine suspenseful thriller set in gorgeous, highly-contrasted black-and-white.  The presence of shadows in each scene and the violent pessimistic script give this film a noir sensibility.  Well directed and acted, this film also gives a true flavor of the 1950's.

166,"This is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that doesn't disappoint.  It's a bleak and distubing look at the world, two decades from now.  Chaos has erupted everywhere as people are overcome by an overwhelming hopelessness.  This fear is generated due to the fact that no child has been born for eighteen years.  It's a countdown to extinction.
 Theo(Clive Owen) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country.  To the casual viewer this may not seem like much of a task, unless you can really submerse yourself in the context of the volatile situation.  I totally got caught up in the effort, completely absorbed by the significance of this mission.  The action really kept me on edge.
 I was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes, you know--hell, fire and brimstone.  Any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points.  This is touched on periodically, but doesn't go too over the top.  I also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read ""Last one to die, please turn out the lights"".  There's always gotta be a prankster.
 Overall, I thought this was a great movie--action-packed, original, and insightful

However, this one's got a secret that he's now got to punish himself for.  The movie moves a little slowly, but definitely gives itself time to build up the characters (not hard, considering it's focused on 'Roman' (Lucky McGee), who gets almost all the screen time).  By the end of the film, I was really starting to feel for the character and hoping to see things go his way, despite his issues.  I have watched this movie a few times now, and will be continuing to do so quite a few more...and am looking forward to the regular DVD release so I can check out the bonus features.

169,". . . then this film may be for you!
 
 Like ""Ju-On: The Grudge,"" ""Ju-On 2"" presents a series of interconnected vignettes. Though the non-linear presentation can sometimes confuse the viewer, it takes only a moment to realize the correlation between the last portrait and the next. So, be patient;)
 
 This film has a bit of a postmodern spin (which many horror-film scholars may enjoy).  One of the main characters, Kyoko Harase, plays an actress known as ""The Queen of Horror."" She is taken to the infamous Saeki home to give a television interview about her own experience as a horror actress. It is there that she is marked with the curse (in a fairly unpredictable way!!) And, there that true horror enters her own life.
 
 To the joy of many viewers, Toshio figures prominently into ""Ju-On 2."" Though the make-up on Toshio is a little flat (unlike ""Ju-On The Grudge"") his acting is still pitch-perfect. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that Yuya Ozeki (who play Toshio Saeki) did not understand the part he was playing in earlier films (simply as a result of his tender age). He has now refused to watch his own films and his parents go to the premieres alone:) (You can discover this information on the American version of ""The Grudge"" in Takashi Shimizu's commentary).  
 
 Some reviewers seem hyper-critical of this work. Yes, the film has some missteps, but they are easily overlooked. If you watched and enjoyed ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" then try ""Ju-on 2"" . . . you might be pleasantly surprised!

 For everyone else, what the DVD chronicles is P Funk the way it sounded and was performed each night in the mid-1970s; you just never knew who may show up to make the concert just a bit more funkier. By the end of the show, the opening act - Sly and The Family Stone - along with Bootsy Collins and members of his Rubber Band are in on the funkified jam.
 
 Recorded in 1976, it was at a time when concerts weren't being chronicled on a nightly basis for possible future use. I would wager that a member of the stage crew decided to capture the gig on tape and it was gathering dust in a vault somewhere before the audio was enhanced about as well as it could have been for release. 
 
 What makes this a special gem is the ""rough"" nature of the video. The band and guest performers were not on stage knowingly making a movie; this is a tour date with all the power, energy & surprises that George Clinton delivered each night to the audience. That in itself makes the DVD an important part of any music collection.

176,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (Jonathan Liebesman, 2006)
 
 In the documentary that serves as one of the DVD extras for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, a number of the movie's connections talk repeatedly about how their goal for this movie was to push the envelope with the gore. One even says that the people who went to see Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) will go to see this movie and expect the violence to be kicked up a notch. Well, folks, I just saw the unrated version of your movie, and I've only seen the rated version of Hostel. And I hate to break it to you but, well, even cut by the censors, Hostel blew you out of the water.
 
 For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty-two years, a quick plot summary: there's a very odd family living out in the middle of nowhere. When the main local business, a slaughterhouse, closed down, it took most of the population with it-- save this family. (The fact that the slaughterhouse is still in operation in the original film, and there are neighbors in some of the original canon films, seems to have completely escaped screenwriter Sheldon Turner [The Longest Yard].) As with any TCM movie, there must be a batch of clueless teenagers, here two guys-- Eric (Tru Calling's Matthew Bohmer), on his way back to Vietnam, and his brother Dean (Zerophilia's Taylor Handley), who's planning on ditching the war and heading for Mexico-- and their girlfriends, Bailey (Diora Baird, recently of Wedding Crashers) and Chrissie (The Fast and the Furious' Jordana Brewster), respectively. There will also be a lot of revving chainsaws.
 
 Now, I readily admit I'm one of the people who didn't recognize the brilliance of Tobe Hooper's original vision for a lot of years after I first saw the original film (close to twenty, in fact)-- thank you, DVD commentary, for pointing out so many things I'd missed my first few times around. I'm still not sure it deserves the classic status it has come up with since, but it's a good, solid piece of work, groundbreaking for its time. There hasn't been a single film, canonical or no, following it that's lived up, but the straight remake Marcus Nispel popped out with a couple of years ago has been the best of a bad lot. Unfortunately, it looks as if the sequels to the remake will have the same relative quality as the sequels to the original-- worse. The acting is wooden, the direction pedestrian, the special effects pretty good but nothing special. But what these guys were after, they tell us, was something really over the top. They were striving not to make a good movie, but to make the mother of all splatter films. And, quite simply, even within the Hollywood machine, they were well upstaged by Hostel before they even started filming. *

These mass murders were a travesty for all, but it is important to understand the history of this hatred that Serbs, Croats, and Muslims had for each other in order to properly put into context these countries as they stand today, slowly trying to rebuild after such a cruel devestation of their homeland as well as their human spirit

181,"Kaufman's adaptation of Michael Crichton's Japan-bashing potboiler is a realtively light approach, a simple buddy-cop movie featuring a pair of entertaining star performances. In spite of the fact the novel's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant Japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between Eastern and Western worlds around a lot of issues, the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal, transforming it into an interesting film, whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures, with Sean Connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations. Yet Sean Connery makes a very credible performance, as the detective, the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys, and the ominous presence of the Japanese mob with pretensions of Noir Film, the picture leaves us a bitter taste, because even if there are good sequences, the whole material promised best best and major intentions.

 the creators took the helm back for the series finale and it focuses on our original 4-5 characters (5 if you include jack), leaving out audrey and others, which i for one VERY MUCH appreciated.  although to me they already had enough of an acceptable reason and to reunite everyone in capeside (five years in the future) and enough material w/which to surprise us (and tie up some loose ends) all in a nice melodramatic/comedic fashion WITHOUT *killing another character off*. (after both abbey and mitch met accidental deaths in earlier seasons, i feel like it gets to be a bit much--but at least this time, there's a believable--although rarely occurring--medical cause.)
 
 at least joey ended up with the right guy (in my not-so-humble opinion).
 
 basically, if you're a committed dawson's (err, joey's ;-) creek fan and want to collect the whole set, you'll want to purchase this season.  otherwise, though, you might consider skipping it and maybe buying the series finale separately.
 
 also, special features were sorely lacking.  this set marked the end of one of the WB's most successful shows that launched acting careers for several young people; the least they could have done is include behind-the-scenes interviews with cast/crew!  creator commentary on the last episode just doesn't cut it

185,"I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.  
 
 The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.
 
 At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.  
 
 I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.
 
 
 On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.  So where is the version with the alternative ending???

187,"I enjoyed this film very much.  It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet.  How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo.  What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters.  In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy.  Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible.  If it is true that gay people look for ""looks in a person first"" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth.  I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him.  One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward.  Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation?  It is a common occurrence in the gay community.  Another implausibility is the ""coming out on a talk show"" with a near ""Jenny Jones"" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David.  One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend.  John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack.  The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last.  Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo?  I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society.  However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way.  Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years.  Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo.  This film is worth a look.

188,"This DVD is pretty good, but the reviews I had read led me to believe I was really going to get an amazing batch of pro secrets. The DVD is good and she does tell some things that you probably haven't heard anywhere else. I am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the FBI and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table. I really thought those two areas were exceptional. It always seems like common sense after you hear it, but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information. 
 
 A few downsides to mention: She discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent. I only play online, so this stuff didn't help me. Also, when she discusses a tell, she performs it herself as she talks about it. When Lederer discussed tells in his DVD, he had actors play them out in a scenario, which I thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember. The DVD never leaves a poker table with her just talking--which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times. Had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little, I think it would have been better. Basically, the DVD gets a little boring after watching it a time or two. 
 
 Wrapping up this review, you have Annie Duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table. It might not be the most entertaining DVD you ever buy, but there is some good information on the DVD. Definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time. If you only play poker online, you can skip this one and wait for her online poker DVD. It should be a better choice. If you play some live poker, I think you'll definitely want to know the information on this DVD. It could really make you more dangerous at the tables.

189,"I really like the Red Sox Trivia and memorabilia found in this movie. It was so fun to see so many of my favorite Red Sox Memories on a movie screen. I thought that Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore did a great job. There was a great chemistry bewteen them. That is to say...I was convinced that they were in love. The ending of the movie was great. I liked the drama of watching Lindsay run across Fenway Park just to get back together with Ben before he sells his tickets. I think the best word to use when describing this movie is ""cute."" 
 
 However, I'm just tired of watching movies that make men look like idiots. Clearly, the main focus of this film is the stupidity of men and how they need women to teach them how to act appropriatly.  I mean, in many ways, Ben is no more mature than an eight year old. That is an extreme and unfair portrayal of male baseball fans in my opinion.

190,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of MIMIC 2. After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good. Now, don't waste your time watching this movie

If all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you.  If you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than I sugest that you don't waste your time and money.  I guess when they cast for an actress here all they were looking for was how well she looks with no clothing on and did not pay attention to the simple fact that this woman has no talent

Not a thought in your head, unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of Scotland since kilts, Gerard Butler.
  Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full ""Atilla"" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable.
  So if you like wire fight scenes, new intrepretations of old myths, Mardi Gras beads and pretty Scots, this is the movie for you. If you want to think, there are plenty of documentary DVDs available on this site!

201,"After the death of his mother, Elijah Wood is left with his uncle's family while dad David Morse takes off for two weeks to settle their future. Uncle has two children: a little girl and an older boy Wood's age: Macaulay Culkin. Behind Culkin's angelic visage, naturally, lurks the soul of a devil. Wood suspects the evil, but no one will believe him, and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing.
 
 Director Joseph P. Ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror, what with this, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy. He claims, in the featurette, to want to reverse our expectations about Culkin's character, which is, of course, nonsense: we know going in that he's bad. And familiar as Evil Child territory is (think The Bad Seed, The Other, The Omen, etc., etc., etc.), this is still an effective example of the genre, benefiting from an admirably economical narrative.
 
 The menu is basic, as are the extras: the theatrical trailer, and the usual featurette. Nuthin' special.
 
 Very much a catalogue-filler release, with no real value-added on this disc. Sound and picture are acceptable, and the movie is a decent 86 minutes

202,"What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ï¿½ The Old Curiosity Shop ï¿½. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.

207,"I can't remember when I saw this one on the big screen.  It was not long after Easy Rider and we had the idea that this Jack Nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70's counter-culture.  He did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting I had ever seen. He out-classed the James Dean's and Marlon Brando's, but not with ease.  Jack was workin' hard, switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood Romeo in five-minute intervals.  No, make that changeable temperament every five seconds, truly an artistic milestone. Throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by Karen Black, sexy and hillbilly; Jessica Simpson, eat your heart out, and you have the couple of the year, 1970.
 
 Jack's father is one of those evil patriarch's that hurt their kids bad, pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love.  Consequently, the siblings are brilliant and eccentric.  The daughter is a frumpy dope.  The older son is a violinist with a neck injury, and then there's handsome Jack, shiftless, moving from bed to bed, crossing the country, a boozing bum.  Back in the Vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life.  Did we have to get a job and get married?  Was everyone in a particular cubbyhole, mail in the funeral?  Hence, we had the counter-culture, drugs, long haired hippies, sexual openness, and shiftless lifestyles. Bob Rafelson's film gives you that, but mercifully, with subtly.  That last scene at the gas station says it all.  I think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing.

209,"After its disturbing and frighteningly chaotic opening sequence, this film swiftly degenerates into another typically stupid, arrogant AMERICAN war film.  Spielberg is a great director, and deserved praise for the opening sequence alone, but what could he do with a screenplay that is little more than a boring melodrama with stereotypical characters who all die in increasingly gruesome ways.  Without the massive buckets of blood, why would we want to watch?  This film is NOT reality, and the fact that it pretends to be reality is offensive to me.  Hollywood's God-complex is its undoing.  Okay lets all pat ourselves on the back one last time for being ""brave"" enough to revel in the glorious bloody pulp of war.  In my opinion, this film is like a horror film with a bad plot.  Imagine having to fight, bleed, and die all kinds of horrific ways for the honor of saving Matt freakin' Damon.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go watch the ending of The Departed again.

210,"Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral &quot;I nearly got crushed in the crowd&quot;, and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies &quot; Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy&quot;. This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers

215,"Upon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder"" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center. 
  
 Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.
  
 Stewart is his dependable self in ""Anatomy of a Murder.""  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  ""Anatomy of a Murder"" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as ""Anatomy of a Murder"" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case

216,"Sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition, but it's not even the butchering that's the problem. The problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book. Jan de Bont decided to take the atmospheric Haunting of Hill House and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting. DePalma went and decided to tone down the racism in Bonfire of the Vanities. But those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to Shlessinger's choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop.
 
 From the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with Faye sighing at Tod's stupid rose, this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad. Even if there wasn't a great book to be killing, this would be a terrible movie. But with Day of the Locust as a source material, the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal. One imagines the book done right by a Quentin Tarantino or a Todd Solondz.
 
 Where the book is fast, the movie is slow. Tod Hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but Shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role. The casting choice is decidedly better with Donald Sutherland as Homer Simpson, but Sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through. Every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of Faye goes on forever.
 
 The riot scene that ends the movie becomes a Night of the Living Dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on. Furthermore, the key sequence of the book (Tod imitating the police sirens) gets lost and Tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something.
 
 This is a terrible movie. The original book deserves much better

218,"I must say the positive reviews here fooled me. I expected much more fun. I would have loved a real blend of soap opera and (even cheap) fantastique. But this doesn't even make the grade as 'so bad it's good' fun, at least for me. Well, maybe the first episode, but the second is just very boring.
 Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies. 
 The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess.
 I guess they didn't have much time to shoot this but overall it's just not worth your time.

219,"In its fourth season, CSI focuses more on the crimes and their participants, although the regular cast does have some momentous moments:  Grissom's surgery results; his involvement or lack of with Sarah, who starts manifesting her own personal crisis; and Catherine finds a new beau and a new paternal figure.  As always, the series is ripe with intriguing plots, forensic facts, and crisp writing, editing and performances.  Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda continue to grow in their roles while Petersen, Helgenberger and Guilfoyle continue to provide the foundation of excellence for this always enjoyable series.  On to Season 5

220,"I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.  
 
 We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...
 
 Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.
 
 Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release

221,"I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""KIDS"", ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"", and ""Traffic"".

223,"This is probably my most favorite movie ever, but I would like to point out to all the people, including the official amazon.com review, that IT ISN'T TEXAS! The movie was filmed in Kern County- specifically Bakersfield, California. Nowhere in the movie does it imply that it is Texas, and in fact locals will recognize many landmarks from the 70's, including I think it is 19th Street with the Hub (where we all bought western clothing and boots), the pawn shops, and the porn shops. The turn-off where Bobby gets caught up playing a piano on the back of the pick-up truck is to Shafter, CA, one of the small dust-bowl era farm towns in Kern County. The bowling alley was Freddy's Top of the Hill on Union Avenue, where we all went bowling in high school. Bobby works not in the Texas oilfields, but in the oilfields, now for the most part non-producing (although the oil supposedly is still there, just being held for economic reasons), that are located out near Taft. Now that that is cleared up- the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion Nicholsons' best and most raw acting, without the goofy cliche crazy Nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work. His scene with his father before he leaves is pure, open, painful emotion- and one of the best performances on-screen of any actor, ever

225,"This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me.  The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene.  The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film

 Spiderwowan: 0 stars
 Crevices: 4 Stars
 The Sacrifice: 2 stars 
 Blonde Kwaidan: -5 stars (negative)
 Presentiment- 1 star
 
 The Spiderwoman was just weird. Like low-budget sci-fi. It lacks an actual plot. 
 *""Crevices"", although short, was really creepy- i think that some of the others could have been taken out to add on to this one. 
 
 ""The Sacrifice"" -was pretty pointless too. You know someone will die, none of the characters will call the police or try and solve this - it just plays out. Frusterating to watch. The lead actress however saves this with above average acting. 
 
 Blonde Swaidan - TERRIBLE. It's a few minutes long and makes no sense. An obsession with blondes -finding a blonde body. How did this make it in??
 
 ""Presentiment"" -A weird kind of ""Final Destination""/Yogen type of idea here, but it just goes too slow and becomes annoying. By the time you know what's going on, you don't care.
 
 In summary, ""Crevices"" is a scary little short  4 stars, and the acting in ""The Sacrifice"" was great, although there was no common sense - don't know how to score that...

229,"Simply put, most horror films don't age well at all. When I use the term ""horror"" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which ""the changeling"" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time.
 
 The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of ""the sixth sense"". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered ""graphic"" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film. If you're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence.... the changeling is a good choice!
 
 Not a perfect film, but an excellent effort that holds up well.

230,"This movie was superb. I wish it was available in PAL (not just US/Canada's NTSC format). I was both inspired not only with it's hysterical, insightful humour, but with it's global appeal. It brings out themes that EVERYBODY can relate to, not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families, but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes. The movie has great wit and side splitting humour. It's such fun to watch and this man is a star!
 
 He really should be more widely recognised world-wide, a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character.
 
 Time to come and do a show in South Africa too!

231,"For thirteen tense days in October, 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  The Soviets had placed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.  These missiles were capable of striking much of the United States and Latin America.  Alerted to the presence of the missiles by a U-2 spy plane photograph, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and the joint chiefs of staff begin to chart a course to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.
 
 The movie is told through the eyes of Presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  Aside from Costner's obviously fake Bostonian accent, the design works quite well.  By telling the story through O'Donnell's eyes, it allows the viewer to focus more on JFK, RFK, and the development of the crisis.  
 
 Directed by Costner as well, the movie describes the entire crisis, from start to finish. From the first discovery of the missiles by the U-2, through the agonizingly long two weeks of decisions and negotiations, to the final outcome, this movie covers all the bases.  I do wish that more attention would have been paid to the Soviet side of the crisis.  I believe that the film would have been more complete had this occurred.
 
 The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Bruce Greenwood gives a compelling and exciting performance as John F. Kennedy, while Steven Culp is equally as good as JFK's younger brother Bobby.  Costner himself is again at his best as O'Donnell, and Michael Fairman does a wonderful job as the embattled Adlai Stevenson, who stands up to the Soviets at the U.N. with his famous ""hell freezes over"" quote.
 
 I give this movie my highest recommendation. October, 1962 was a tense time for the world, and this great movie does a fine job of depicting the missile crisis.  As with its earlier predecessor ""The Missiles of October"", this film describes exactly how close the world came to nuclear war.

This movie is outrageous and shows the hilarious side of vulgar language.  Any South Park fan who is offended by vulgar language is used to the show being cencored on TV.  This movie is not for the easilly offended.  Especially for people easily offended to the F word.  This movie is hilarious and extremely outrageous.  On Comedy Central they got away with airing it on TV only by showing it uncencored.  Great film for the South Park fan and the ones not offended buy vulgar language

This stupid girl (Rachel is her name) soured me on the whole book!  This is not the way that people would really act in this situation.  Collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much.

239,"I origionaly didn't want to watch this film I mean come on a film starring Sandra Bullock but it was my girlfriend who suggested that I watch this film and said that I might like it and now I admit it was pretty good. Sandra Bullock plays a woman named Birdee Pruitt who believes to be happy with a perfect life until she appears on national television and hears her best friend confessing to an affair with her husband. She then leaves her married home and travels to her birth place in Texas where she begins to rebuild her life and relationships especialy with her mother and young daughter who hates Birdee. I was surprised that the film didn't have any cliche Hollywood moments and it dealt with human emotions and was realistic, Birdee has to overcome the humiliation and public betrayal she obviously has a lot of problems but soon Harry Connick jr.'s character comes along to hopefully win Birdee's heart since they knew each other from Highschool. The film was very uplifting and in a way it is a serious romantic drama with a bit of humor so I enjoyed this film alot and I didn't hesitate the fact that I like Sandy in these roles and everybody else gave a great performance and I hope that she stars in more films like this instead of those awful comedies, I highly recomend this film

The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film

243,"Accomplished director Sidney Lumet directs a insightful and prophetic satire from the expansive mind of Paddy Chayefsky critiquing the business of network television production.
 
 CCA corporation frontman Frank Hackett played by Robert Duvall has taken over UBS network with the idea of finally turning it +
 into a profitable situation.  Lagging in ratings behind the big three, Duvall focuses on the news division headed by Max Schumacher played by the aged but excellent William Holden.  Duvall's plan calls for the firing of long time news anchor Howard Beale played superbly in Oscar winning fashion by Peter Finch.
 
 A disconsolate Finch announces on air that in one weeks time, he will blow his head off during his newscast.  His ratings take an immediate bump which comes to the attention of intensely obsessed TV generation programing vice president Diana Christiansen played by Faye Dunaway.  Dunaway encourages Holden to keep Finch on the air, against his better judgement but the ratings hike eventually flattens out.
 
 As Finch's time in gradually coming to an end, he has a bedroom epiphany which inspires him to come on the air after walking the rainy streets in his pajamas.  In a heartfelt spew with wild gesticulations he calls for those watching who are frustrated with their existence, to open their windows and yell that they 're mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore.  His rant strikes home and before long he is a media darling with the number one rated show.  This opens the door for Dunaway to fill her programing schedule with wild and revolutionary shows which threaten to drive UBS to the top of the network heap.
 
 As profits soar, corporate head Arthur Jensen played by supremely talented Ned Beatty is pleased.  However Finch goes too far with his angry prophet routine speaking out against corporate business practices.  He receives an angry rebuke in a brilliant soliloquy by Beatty, who decides that due to a ratings drop that Finch must be silenced.
 
 A combination of Lumet's top notch direction, a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make ""Network"" an all time cinematic classic

247,"I remember this show very well.Just as the sun dipped out of sight the stage lights went on and the band blasted into ""Pearly Queen"" and ""Medicated Goo"" and it was like muscial heaven hearing this stuff actually played live (after hearing it so many times on CD). The only way to really experience TRAFFIC is live and this tour was the last chance to do that (now that Wood and Capaldi are both gone).  TRAFFIC's sound remains unique, its never really been imitated. And this band has never received much radio attention (save the occasional  ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"") and though everyone knows who Steve Winwood is, a lot of people still don't know TRAFFIC's music. But thats fine with me, they are like a well kept secret and this allowed us fans to be able to actually afford tickets to see them when they came through our towns in the summer of '94.  Another advantage of this bands notoriety-lesness is that none of these songs sound dated. In fact much of the TRAFFIC catalogue (with the exception of a few psychedelic numbers on their first two albums)sounds timeless (I'm thinking here especially of the JOHN BARLEYCORN and WHEN THE EAGLE FLIES albums). Masterfully played and highly evocative folk and jazz as well as good ol' blues-based rock does not date. Hearing these styles played next to each other as well as mixed together is as exciting as music gets. I must say,though, that the sole number played from their new album FAR FROM HOME called ""Mozambique"" sounds a bit too much like SANTANA. That doesn't mean its not a good song and I love SANTANA but it didn't make me want to buy FAR FROM HOME.  
 
 I was not a first generation TRAFFIC fan but I became interested in the band in the early 90's so this tour came along at just the right time for me. I've never been a Steve Winwood fan and his solo stuff just seems weak and souless to me. I would say his solo stuff sounds like a watered down radio friendly TRAFFIC or a TRAFFIC without the imagination but to my ears his solo stuff just doesn't sound like TRAFFIC at all.  With the SPENCER DAVIS GROUP and with BLIND FAITH (and a live DVD of BLIND FAITH is now available as well) and especially with TRAFFIC, however, Winwood made music that is absolutely unique and has that unforgettable magic to it that few folk/rock/jazz/blues groups or groups of any kind ever capture. 
 
 This was really a great show, and the art work that was displayed behind the band was perfect, mysterious and a bit surreal though in a very appealing way, so the show was evocative to the ear and the eye. 
 Plus it was summertime, outside, and a river flowed quietly behind the stage as the band played.  I don't think I stopped grinning through the whole set. 
 
 That said I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD as it just didn't match my own memory of this show.  The filmmaking here is just plain amateurish so as a collection of great songs this works, but as a concert artifact I think its much less succesful.  That amateurism might have worked had the filmmakers simply employed handmade cameras for that would have created an improvised spontaneous feel to go along with the spontneous improvised music. The filmakers should have taken a more subdued, as well as maybe a bit more avant-garde approach, but, instead, the filmamkers got busy and decided to decorate or trash a perfectly good concert video with some unforgivably cheesy and painfully obvious special effects and visual metaphors (traffic lights, time-lapse highway travel, traffic)which were nowhere near as subtle and evocative as the graphics that adorned the stage. These 'special' effects were just not that special, and they give the video all of the visual mystery and excitement of a local televison commercial.  The idea, apparently, was to share with the DVD audience the feel of traveling with the band but the filmmakers seem to forget that what we want to watch over and over is not the interviews and sound bites and jump-cuts to band members getting on tour buses or hanging out in hotel rooms(unless its a band that is doing something that we want to see like say the Stones in '72 ) but these guys when offstage just seem like ordinary guys who are not really interested in tearing it up. The music itself is what counts, the musicians say so themselves, and thats what we want too, the music. Lets face it Winwood is a genius onstage (so long as he's surrounded by great players that allow him to jam) but a dynamic off-stage presence he's not, so he's just not that interesting to follow around. Capaldi, on the other hand, has great camera presence and his character and humor really come across. His mugging for the camera is on occasion pretty funny. But, on several occasions, the filmakers cut-away from musical jams in progress in order to give us more of this stuff and this is sheer madness. When you buy a live album or a live DVD (especially one of a band that is known for its awesome jam potential) the one thing that you do not want is for those jams to be interrupted or edited or interefered with in any way. This music is sacred so light up, enjoy, and leave it alone. Really not cool of the vidoegraphers to cut-away mid-jam ever for any reason!  Note to future concert vidoegraphers: keep camera focused on the band, watching them play is plenty of entertainment. If you want to cut-away occasionally to show crowd shots thats fine so long as its a shot of a dancing girl soaking-up-the-music-and-sun, but no cut-aways that involve cutting songs short (as these filmmakers do in the middle of ""Glad""). Also probably would have been best to leave Jerry Garcia out of the ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" sequence, Jerry just wasn't feeling the song, so why do we need to watch Jerry not Feelin' all that Alright. I love Jerry but I don't want a video record of this particular moment which was not one of his best. 
 
 I am guessing that this DVD was the work of more than one filmmaker because occasionally it does achieve that ground level and grassroots feel that we want from a live performance that we attended and have more than fond memories of.  Of course the people we see at the concert on this video are not the ones we saw when we were there (our own absence from the procedings is maybe why concert videos always seem to be mssing some key ingredient) but it is nice to be reminded that part of the concert experience is what happens before the show, and what happens offstage in the audience during the show while sitting on the grass among strangers who are nonetheless feeling the vibe along with ya. 
 
 No better show opener than ""Pearly Queen"" and no better show closer than the TRAFFIC version (complete with long drum build up) of ""Gimme Some Lovin'"".....lots of good stuff inbetween as well...""40,000 headmen"" & ""John Barleycorn"".....
 
 At the show I saw I do seem to remember hearing ""Empty Pages"" and ""Dream Gerard"" in addition to the rest of the set list on this DVD. So, what's up videographers?
 
 By the way these performances sound virtually identical to the live versions of these songs on WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN and that is not a bad thing since that is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. If you are new to TRAFFIC and don't really want or need a concert DVD but want to experience the live TRAFFIC then WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN is the way to go. CANTEEN has ""Pearly Queen"" and ""Medicated Goo"" as well as ""40,000 Headmen"" and ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and Gimme Some Lovin'"" but it also has three Dave Mason songs so you get ""Feelin' Alright"", ""Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave"", and ""Sad and Deep as You.""

248,"In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.
 
 It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.
 
 He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.
 
 The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.
 
 The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying ""What the hell is going on?""  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.  Besides, the ending sucks

The story is so typical girl with two kids looking for some sap to help her out so she picks a naive high school grad.  pulls some smooth sex moves on the poor kid and gets his pee-pee all in a whirl and he becomes king kong and wants to protect her from her ""horrible"" estranged hubby, and play daddy to her brats. Its a no win situation, legally he's an ""adult"" so mom and dad can't forbid him from diddling with the tramp and unfortunatly he's in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets killed for no good reason.  And she ends up going back to her estranged hubbby and thinks what he did to get her back was soooo romantic.  The world is full of dumb c--ts and even dumber men.  Don't bother with this one

I tried to keep them interested and have the DVD help explain some of the underlying theories that I found so interesting in Dan Brown's book, but the ""expert"" interviews were sloppy and not engaging.  When I switched to the extras, hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book, the glimpses of Westminster Abbey and The Louvre were very brief while the Rosslyn Church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work.

255,"Few sequels live up to the original, and I consider that the case here.  Picking up where the first movie left of, the action quickly moves as Farmer Hoggett falls into a well and hurts himself, the wife fails at farming, so she and Babe go to the city to find help.  Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day.  The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one.  Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite.  Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes.  The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better.  The overall look of the movie is darker too; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky, we have concrete, roads, and building walls.  This reviewer did not like this movie that much, and was disappointed.

256,"The title of this movie refers to the widow Mrs. Henderson, a rich member of England's upper crust at the beginning of WWII.  Having lost a husband years earlier, and a son to WWI, she needs something to do, and so buys the Windmill Theater in London.  Pouring her money into it and pulling some political strings, she turns it into a first class theater that runs shows with young, beautiful, nude women in it.  Her aim, to entertain young English lads before they are sent of to war.  This she does, but various tragedies strike along the way, such as one of her ""actresses"" getting pregnant by a married soldier.  
 
 This DVD set includes several features, one of which is the story of the real theater and interviews with actual actresses who worked there.  Yes, this movie is based on real-life events and people, and it seems the producers went out of the way to make the movie as historically true as possible.  All in all, this movie is a great combination of history, tragedy, and comedy, and worth watching

258,"I recall first watching this movie with my ex-friend and I took a trip down the coast. I wasn't really expecting much, pretty much just another slapstick, stupid comedy. But to be totally honest, this movie is really awesome! ""Hotshots,"" ought to have you rolling around the floor in some instances. But first, a look at the ""storyline.""
 
 Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the son of a famous air ace who died um...tragically in an F-15 crash landing and a terrible mix-up regarding moose hunting season. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a flying wonder. This briefly sums up the main ""story,"" but there are many other smaller stories including that of Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) and Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) who fights his own personal war against the terrible ailment of Wall Eye Vision. That aside, Topper Harley must find out what really happened to his dad and help both his friends and himself to achieve their dreams, even if it goes to ridiculous proportions.
 
 You may think that this is a movie that merely takes the piss out of movies like ""Top Gun,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Kickboxer,"" but...well, you're right. But the satire is clever (yet decidedly idiotic), and it certainly succeeds in making just about everything totally ridiculous. Don't expect realism, objectivenes and logic in this movie - that's not the point of it. It's there as a satire, and really is a classic satirical film of the 1990's. The appeal of ""Hotshots"" is the sheer stupidity and absurdity of many of the events that take place in the movie, and of course, if you've watched the movies that are being ripped off, you'll really laugh your head off.
 
 The best character has to be Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges). He performs the role of a supposedly ""hardened"" war-veteran and a man who has seen much conflict with great gusto. It just goes to show that some vets get more violent, others more angry, some sad - and Benson just gets dumber. He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)
 
 All in all, ""Hotshots,"" is a moronic, silly, yet extremely funny and witty slapstick comedy. If you like Monty Python style humour or just love classic slapstick, this movie is undoubtedly for you. Otherwise, if you like intelligent comedy, stay the hell away from ""Hotshots."" It's not meant to be intelligent, so remember that. But at the end of it all, it'll always be a classic slapstick, silly comedy! Buy it, rent it, steal it today

264,"Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms.

The vivid transparency  from which the director coaxes  all the many simple details is astonishing. This sort of cinema must be very hard to bring together as almost no one can really pull it off. The Japanese director Ozu was the master of it.And this is about as close as can get to a modern version of him. It's really about the events of two brothers in  childhood  and I can't say enough good about it. 
 I have seen it twice and I can only imagine it getting better with successive viewings. The only sort of awkward bit for me was when nature talked back in the guise of woodland hags etc.. but I never thought nature needed a human voice to speak for itself

266,"Poltegeist is the worst DVD set that I ever purchased. The plots are the most ridiculous and amateurish that I have ever encountered. Characters have no clear delineation, they hover over any terrain that the writers hoist on them. Contradictions and sheer lunacy are admitted into the script if the story demands it. Characters who are sceptical one minute, suddenly swing wildly into occult belief full of knowledge of mystical arcana. The actors try to make this schmaltz work, however, at times their faces, confused at the blatant absurdity of the script, collapse into pseudo profound baffoonery. Ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you cannot even expel didainful laughter. This show is not even a ""turkey"" because the sheer stupidity of the script elicits revulsion of such a sharp quality that you can only dream of smashing the DVD's with a hammer to eleviate the loathing that overwhelms your mind while wasting your life watching this dross. This show is so awful, I couldn't give it away as a present for the justified fear that the recipient would promptly end our dear friendship due to the insult of unloading this manure to their dwelling.

268,"The premise - that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller.  I don't condemn the film's corollary either: that each change produces new, unforseeable tragedies.  It's the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot, its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities.
      It is therefore fitting that the director's preferred ending is included here.  It is the perfect catharsis for teens who ""...wish I was never born!

269,"There are far too few movies that are made just for fun these days. Down Periscope is proof that you don't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie. My teenagers loved it, setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers.
 
 Kelsey Grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role, playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie. Known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub (an old rusty diesel boat) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern Navy. Fortunately Grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone. 
 
 The crew consists of stereotypes, from the flatulant cook, to the grizzled old veteran, to the spoiled son of an admiral, to the basketball star, to the spit-and-polish XO, but the actors manage to bring them off with charm, especially the electrician who Grammer notes has ""absorbed a lot of voltage"". In addition to the big laughs, there are the little scenes that bring a smile, such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to ""see if the other rooms are still tilted""
 
 Ultimately it is a feel-good movie. It doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts, but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch!
 
 Of special note, San Franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the ""mothball fleet"" in Suisun Bay and the docked sub shots of the ""Stingray"" are the USS Pampanito, a sub open for tours at Pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end.

270,"Starting in 1995, the New York City program in ballroom dance now includes 6000 children from all burroughs of the city.
 
 This documentary observes 11 year olds learning body discipline, social etiquette, appropriate attire on their way to achieving a sense of self respect, personal dignity. 
 
 Some of the children inhabit neighborhoods where they stumble across drug addicts and dealers each day. The teachers of 3 different schools reveal secret tricks to overcome physical and social awkwardness in children and open them to their potential for becoming accomplished through structure, practice and smiling.
 
 The children openly discuss their fears (my dad cheated on my mom) and hopes (do you like girls?) between classes as they march toward the selection process for the citywide competition (bronze, silver, gold levels) quarter, semi-finals and the glorious finals outdoors in sunlight.
 
 The music is charming nostalgic, the dancing exhilarating; the children's enjoyment of their bodies in motion is contagious.

271,"Hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character, against all the Indiana Joneses and Bruce Lees of the world. Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.

272,"Gantz is a tense, emotion wringing story with a lot of blood and a side portion of sex.  Unless you are very tolerant of hardship, blood and sex this isn't for young children.  Parents won't want their children to watch these episodes until they are 18, teenagers will love watching the show when they are 15 and perhaps even a bit younger and will miraculously be totally unharmed except being exposed to a couple of interesting ideas.
 
 Ideas (certainly not comprehensive):
 1) What happens after you die could be Heaven or Hell, could be nothing, or it could be something else entirely that no one has considered before
 2) Young men tend to be more horny than have sense.  (Amazing how for some reason this just isn't projected most times there are teenagers around)
 3) Materialist idea of 'you' or 'I'.  It appears that almost all of the characters in the show are 'captured' at the time of their death and recorded and transported to Gantz.  This either implies that the soul is recordable and recreatable or that the soul is unnecessary in the recreation of a person.
 4) The weaponry appears to be fairly original.
 
 Kei Kurono is certainly the most interesting character in the series.  He can be annoying and is certainly obsessed with sex, but I think that merely makes him a relatively accurrate depiction of a teenage male.
 
 One of the key points in this very violent series is that violence is real and although the activities in the Gantz games are certainly violent, you can't get away from violence even in a place that should be safe like home.  This is demonstrated by Kato's little brother being beaten by their Aunt that is taking care of them because their parents are dead.
 
 The effects of violence at home, rather than violence in the Gantz activities are what appear to motivate Kato to incredible rages.  Kato, who is the most reasoning character in the series.  Kato, who is unable to kill in order to survive or even protect his friends - is driven by the violence at home and school to beat people insensible.
 
 The series is neat.  Not all questions are answered in the first series.  Nor, I suspect are they answered completely in the second season.  Some questions perhaps we do not have the answers.  Some answers are held in the Manga and possibly Japanese Anime versions of the show.
 
 I hope they continue to produce Gantz Anime, and perhaps some of those answers will be revealed.  Perhaps it will be like the original Guyver series.  One of the best Anime I've watched and I was horrified that the end, was in fact the end.  Clearly a show (just as Gantz) that there is plently of material to continue the story.
 
 While I'd love to continue reading the story in the Manga, it appears to currently not be available in English.
 
 I will hope that people will be able to watch this show and not be put off by the sex and violence contained within it - just as they are contained in real life.  It certainly provided me with a nice diversion.
 
 Oh, and yes, I hate the fact that there are only 2 episodes per disk.  Who makes that kind of decision?  I have anime with 5 episodes per disk, 2 episodes per disk but most commonly 4 episodes per disk.
 
 Don't waste resources people!  13 episodes could have easily fit on 3 disks compared to 6!  The extra disks, cost to the manufacturer, extra materials for disk holders and the large box - man - it just makes sense to shave some cents off the cost of the series and sell it for the same amount and make more money than waste all those disks with 2 episodes each.
 
 Blech.  Good thing I really like the series.
 
 Atheists, agnostics and secular humanists will probably enjoy this series as well as people who are fairly moderate in temperance.
 
 Folks that take their religion too seriously, don't like anime, don't like sex or feel that there is too much violence on TV - need not apply.
 
 Funny how this is a Japanese animation, with so much blood, guts and sex and they have lower incidences of violence in their country than in the USA.  Must not be the violence and sex on TV that causes the problems, folks!  If blood, guts and sex on TV causes it in reality then Japan must be overrun with roving gangs, rapes and thousands of murders, but we know this is not true

274,"Alright, let's do this one up on the bounce and by the numbers: 
 
 1) Bridget Fonda is red-smoking hot. Fire-breathing dragon hot. Albeit in an angular, toothy kind of wait, which, don't get me wrong, is just fine. 
 
 2) Bridget Fonda plays Maggie, who, with some Pantera-lovin' buds break into a pharmacy to get a little Better Living Through Pharmacology, unleash a little jihad on the owner, and get themselves into a firefight. 
 
 Everybody gets riddled with bullets, except Maggie, who, in the wretched bowels of withdrawal and all-twitchy-like, greases a cop. 
 
 3) Note: did I mention that ""Point of No Return"" is a big-studio remake of Luc Besson's utterly insane, bump-n-grind brutal, deliciously bleak and nihilistic ""Nikita""? I did not? Shoot me. No, no, put down that Steyr sniper rifle, I'm kidding there Cowboy, sheesh...
 
 4) With that in mind, all you need to know is this: studio director John Badham (who directed, ummm, the cinematic marvels ""Bird on a Wire"" and ""Short Circuit"", which proves he's a real, er, edgy dude) churned out what amounts to a shot-for-shot remake of ""Nikita"". Only it's like the carbon dioxide remake of ""Nikita"": odorless, colorless, and tasteless.
 
 5)Alright: so Maggie gets hauled into a supermax facility, deep-sixed by the Government, manhandled a little too much by Super-Duper-Secret Agent Bob (Gabriel Byrne, starting his slow slide from sneering, edgy brilliance into avuncular B-movie actor Hell), erased from the Big Book of Life and super-shuttled down a little Orwellian ""memory-hole"", and offered a choice: Society made you, baby. Now we'll give you your Murder 101 Training, and you can be a sanctioned killer. 
 
 6) That's about it. It's basically ""Nikita"", without the hip and happening and totally ominous techno-score, without Luc Besson's surreally grim edginess and sublime cinematography, with New Orleans dubbing for Nice (without even the fun of a Hurricane, or a shoot-out at the Superdome, which might have enlivened this turd). It's like ""Nikita"" with all the fun and style and gratuitous killing bled out. 
 
 7) That said, Fonda looks good writhing around on a bed in her Hello Kitty panties. 
 
 8) Oh, and Harvey Keitel shows up in an Enzo Ferrari, I think, though I was way too liquored up by then to care. Do you care? He's channeling The Terminator by way of a tax accountant, and was way too goofy to live. 
 
 9) The original ""Nikita"" showed me something I'd never seen before: an Indonesian diplomat literally getting flushed down a toilet. This one showed me something I've seen many times: an edgy, nasty, grimy, kinetic foreign flick getting flushed down the remake toilet. 
 
 Terminate with Extreme Prejudice.

I find it supremely ironic that Disney felt it necessary to turn a murderous troop of Marxist guerrillas into a murderous, greedy mining agent - this from one of the most devouring, money-hungry corporations in the history of capitalism! Did they perhaps believe that depicting a troop of black soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family wouldn't be as politically correct (or as comprehensible to a pre-teen or early teen audience) as showing a greedy white mining agent ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family? Of course, Francois Joubert simply has to be transformed into the obnoxious Harry Winslow (to make the movie more appealing to an American audience). And must every story involving young people of opposite sexes be turned into a ""Girls are stupid! - Boys are stupider! - I love you! - I love you too!"" tale of teenage battle of the sexes turned to love? It's been many years since I read the novels, but I don't remember that particular twist to the story, perhaps because Van der Post wasn't necessarily writing for the 11-14-year-old American market.

288,"""The Hospital"" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character.

Excepting for a chance to look at Jacqueline Lord (a Catherine Zeta Jones look, act, and dress alike) for a little while, and her acting wasn't very good most of the time, there are no redeeming aspects to this film.
 
 For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements.  The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film.  Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences.  Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.
 
 Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.

Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, ""The Descent"" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, ""The Descent""
 
 ""The Descent"" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.
 
 At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.
 
 Even though ""The Descent"" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.
 
 ""The Descent"" is unrated and contains violence and language

292,"This made for TV Canadian adaptation of the Washington Irving story is more faithful than the Tim Burton movie. (Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version

293,"Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.
 Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.
 It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.
 If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market

295,"One of the best of the head-in-a-box genre (see also ""The Head"" (1959) Victor Trivas, dir; ""The Frozen Dead"" (1966) starring Dana Andrews) this particular movie is enlivened by the relentless saxophone score and the notion of a man out shopping for bodies for his decapitated fiancee at strip clubs. Hey! Might as well have the best! 
 The story is straightforward and stupid: a car crash decapitates the fiancee, so of course the only rational response to this predicament is to keep her head alive in a box in the basement. Why couldn't he keep her body alive, too, then just stitch them back together? Well, the scientist boyfriend must have lost his head because he didn't think about this course of action. Or many he was thinking with his little head and seized the opportunity to create a more bodilicious girlfriend with some cut and paste action!
 Anyway, the girlfriend gets jealous...watch out for a woman scorned! ""No baby, it's not like that. I was at the strip club looking for new bodies for you!"" Yeah right try that out around MY house and see what happens. Anyway, the plan goes awry and the nasty humanoid critter gets out of the closet (Ohhh I'm in a cold sweat over that one) and the movie finally ends. And not with the expected bang, either.
 Fabulous hideous terrible schlock. Highly recommended!

296,"The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.
 
 There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.
 
 The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.
 
 The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.
 
 If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd

All I can say is thank god that Dante altered it.

His memorable portrayal of a Tokyo crime boss is the best thing in ""House of Bamboo"" (1955) -- director Samuel Fuller's flat attempt at Japanese film noir.

She is the only redeeming part of this rather silly movie, not even product placment clips of Paul Newman and Robert Redford make it bearable. Hideous accents abound and way to many sexual references i.e. statues in the Louvre, porno flick to make it really innocent. Olivier is really pretty awful, he must have been really hard up for money to support Joan Plowright and the kids.  Broderick Crawford playing himself is even worse.  Where did they come up with this cast?  So rent Henry V or Rebecca for Olivier; All the Kings Men for Crawford; Long Hot Summer for Newman; The Great Gatsby or Butch Cassidy for Redford and just say no to A Little Romance.

304,"This is a cool video, just from the standpoint of watching Jaco Pastorius play, however it's wrong to say that it is a bass instruction video. It's just two bassists swapping ideas. There is no time spent demonstrating any kinds of technique or style, and the accompanying booklet is pretty useless, as it doesn't suggest fingerings, or strings, which is OK for a tune, but pointless for an excercise. The only way you'll learn from this is to go through it frame by frame and hope you'll be able to figure out how he's playing.
 
 Also not so good from terms of performance, Jaco's not at his best here, and has put a fretted neck on his fretless for demonstartion, but it slows him down in the live jam.

305,"Roger Michell's ""The Mother"" ranks with ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" as one of the most unpleasant, profoundly disturbing portraits of a dysfunctional family ever put on film. It is also undeniably brilliant at showing the frayed knots of family loyalty that only need one good shock to break irrevocably. Hanif Kureishi--an old hand at making audiences squirm--tells the story of May (Anne Reid), a sixtyish housewife in a semi-rural English town, visiting her children in London with her husband Toots (Peter Vaughan). Ten minutes into the movie, Toots dies, leaving May totally at a loss. As the film makes plain from the beginning, May's life has revolved entirely for decades around caring for Toots. At first we think the film will be a poignant study of a woman's grief. May doesn't want to go back to her empty house, but her children plainly don't want her around: her son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) is a cold, self-centered businessman, and her daughter Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a needy, whining neurotic who blames her mother for nearly everything that's gone wrong with her life. We think the story will be about May's learning to stand up for herself and make a new life. (When Bobby asks May not to be difficult, she stiffens and asks, ""Why shouldn't I be difficult?"") But then May meets Darren (Daniel Craig), Paula's sexy, moody boyfriend and a man half May's age, and from then on all expectations fly straight out the window and land with a crash. I wish the publicity for the film didn't reveal what happens between May and Darren, but even so the impact of it assaults the audience like the punch in the face Paula eventually gives May. If the movie were just about an elderly woman's sexuality, it wouldn't be so shocking; what shocks is May's selfish betrayal of Paula, and the brutal fashion in which Paula discovers it. At that moment we lose all our moorings as an audience, and have no idea who among the characters to side with, if anyone. We still have sympathy for May--as we don't for the patently hateful Paula, Darren and Bobby--but we also gasp in horror at her heedless behavior, and get an idea why her children turned out the way they did. ""The Mother"" is hard to sit through, and also hard to forget.

309,"""Children of Paradise"" is set in pre 1840 Paris, on Boulevard of Crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic. It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-François Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances). 
 
 Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph. It is a 190 minutes long film but I cherished every minute of it.

At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.

  To cater to action fans, it is said that Don and Bruce (Campbell) were talking about having Bruce in Phantasm 5 and tie the Evil Dead franchise into it somehow, which could work considering that both of them deal with trancendence of time and space, and both seem to root themselves in the Lovecraftian mythos, not to mention the fact that Phantasm 2 and 3 were total Evil Dead, as well as Bubba Ho-Tep which Don aslo directed!

 As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.
 
 As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.
 
 The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.
 
 Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.

331,"Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War.  It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands.  While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them.
 
 The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations.  Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler.   
 
 MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions.  It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam.  It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him.  It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq.    
 
 Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 11.  In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject.  (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get).
 
    1. Empathize with your enemy.
    2. Rationality will not save us.
    3. There's something beyond one's self.
    4. Maximize efficiency.
    5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war.
    6. Get the data.
    7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong.
    8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.
    9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.
   10. Never say never.
   11. You can't change human nature.
 
 What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration.  That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson.  
 
 Fog of War is an excellent film.  In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters.  Pure evil does exist.  It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal.

Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen.
 
 The film is supplemented on this DVD with a ""Making-of"" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this ""inside"" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), ""When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me,"" - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age.
 
 Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more ""real"" than many of today's ""realities"" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-

335,"This is one of my favorite movies! Tom Ewell is a hoot as Richard Sherman, a man with an overactive imagination. We don't believe him for a minute when he swears to himself he is not going to smoke, drink, etc. while his wife and son are away because we know he doesn't have the will power. He really wants these things, yet seven years of marriage has ingrained his wife's nagging into his conscience. His wife's voice is always there and he is now no longer able to go through a day and complete simple tasks without constantly grappling with himself for permission. And then Marilyn Monroe moves in upstairs for the summer. Is there no mercy? Monroe and Ewell are great, Wilder keeps up the pace and the supporting parts are spot-on. Wonderful! The picture has been restored and is presented widescreen, so you cannot go wrong.

336,"I knew going in that this would not be a masterpiece of filmmaking, but always the optimist, I naively assumed that it may have some redeeming virtues. I was wrong. Every second watching this abomination is a second wasted. The script, acting, direction, sound, cinematography, plot, etc. are just plain awful. Indeed, the overall quality is so low that it cannot be explained simply by a lack of money or talent....it is like some awful inside joke played upon the audience. Don't fall for it.

337,"I have my doubts as to Santana' music for quiet a long time- it seems that he loves his place and role as a rock icon too much and forgot to do music. Let me be more specific- I never liked his salsa last records and thought that this is no music. For a guitar player who invented new ideas and streams in the rock guitar-playing world, these records were an insult- no less. I am really sure that Santana himself admits- deep down in his heart- that he looks for better music. It can be that these guilt feelings brought him to ""create"" this DVD. Well, if I am right in my analysis, he did wrong in his music, again. Nothing connects Santana to the blues and he will not convince (at least me) that he was raised on the knees of the blues. C'mon, forty years of career and now he revels that he is rooted in the blues??  Sorry, I don't buy it. Now, as Santana is not a blues guitar player, and never was- this DVD cannot be good and there are a lot of reasons for it: Santana' playing the blues is loud and vulgar while all other three guitar players (Bobby Parker, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown and Buddy Guy) have a small and unique sound, Santana' technique (which was always amazing) covers a lack of touch and feeling while all three base their playing on feeling, emotion and the right sound- Santana, on the other hand, covers his disadvantages in playing the blues with all lot of notes. Now, if you want to purchase good blues guitar playing DVD go for each of the three (meaning: Bobby Parker, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown and Buddy Guy) for their own records. If you like Santana (past or present) go for his own but, don't mix between them as Santana did. One more thing- Santana relates to Jeff Beck in his words added to this DVD and I agree that this is a good example- anyone who wants to understand the meaning of the blues and rock/blues guitar should address to Jeff Beck, not to Santana whom we still expect, after so many years, to create real music.

338,"Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.
 
 Despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
 
 I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)

He is faced with what appear to be insurmountable odds, and he is a ""nice guy.""  Therefore, the audience is hoping that somehow things will work out for him, but it is very uncertain what will happen!  This picture is a bit dark, so be aware that you may find yourself shocked at times, but hang on to the end.  It's worth it!

342,"The best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and Scorsese's knowledge of New York personalities. But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets.
 
 From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy.
 
 Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking.
 
 I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing ""it's funny"" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny

343,"Francisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.
 
 The review on the back of the dvd says ""jaw dropping, "" but the full quote probably reads ""jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)"". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant ""evil side of human nature"" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said ""yeah, it needs some CONFLICT"". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of ""social commentary,"" but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags. 
 
 All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron.

344,"If I had to choose ONE movie to show and teach students the secrets of great actors-directing, it would be this one. The destiny of Peter Bogdanovich is amazing: celebrated as one of the world's best directors in the early 70s, he fell into disgrace because of private problems in the 80s, and rarely got a chance to direct anymore except for TV. Somehow it reminds me of the destiny of Wim Wenders, also celebrated as the new big thing in the 70s, and much disregarded today.
 Both judgements were excessive. They probably weren't the best directors in the world in the 70s - but surely aren't the worst today.
 
 This movie is a little, much under-rated and overlooked, certainly humble and understated gem. Bogdanovich shows here what it means to direct actors in a way that enhances their performances and brings out deep emotions. This is not a superficial movie. Instead, it is one that bears repeated viewings. And it has much of what life has: truth, emotions, changes. I especially like the ending. It seems to get back to the beginning, but it's not. Somehow, everything is there, but everything has changed forever. It's a happy ending, but bittersweet too. And like real life, it goes on, on a road where you can't follow, just like those friends you had and never met again, or just like your past memories.
 
 I've been waiting for a decade to get a dvd of this movie. And I bought it immediately as it came out, because it is really unsure that they may ever reprint this once the first bunch is gone. So get it, don't miss it, this is the best advice I can give. Don't miss the experience of this movie. This is no special fx movie. This is actors cinema at its best. Something rare

But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like ""Desert Heat."" If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away

352,"This movie is one of my kids' favorites. In fact, it was the first live-action movie my older daughter could sit through, probably because it's pretty cartoonish live-action. The nice thing is that grownups can stand to watch it, too. It's very silly, of course, but there are lots of funny gags, many of which go right over the heads of children. There's a little bathroom humor, but what else would you expect in a movie with talking gorillas and an elephant that plays fetch? Best of all, from my point of view, is the fact that perfectly-cast Brendan Fraser spends a good portion of the movie wearing only a loincloth.
 
 I agree with other reviewers, however, that it would be nice if the DVD were in widescreen and came with some extras. But I'll settle for 90 minutes of happy children plus Brendan Fraser in a loincloth

353,"I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them.  However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed.  The camera man can't seem to sit still.  When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do.  By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow.  Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise.  It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment

 A relentless rant against Rupert Murdoch's cable news station, this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with Fox News, but I cannot imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in Fox News to remain awake while watching this movie.
 
 Watching OUTFOXED makes me realize what a genius Michael Moore is.  Whether you love him or hate him, whether you agree with him or not, you have to admit his films are entertaining.  This film, however, is a major bore.

359,"After watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects (geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line) or that it is a complete mess. I admit that I enjoyed what I thought was mindless entertainment, but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what I thought was a Hollywoodish Anime (not a good thing). However I was fortunate to see one OVA  at a time, therefore I watched the first OVA about three times, the second two times and at last all three together (these three are what make up the contents of this DVD). So by the time I finished this first half of the story I pretty much understood it.
 This DVD entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story.  Honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in. It appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once; however I believe that is what he intends. As the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine (OVA to OVA). So expect the first OVA to be the most complicated and confusing. but if you Read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it. 
 Finally, the animation and CG is second to none. It is an extremely beautiful anime.
 
 Sooo, I highly recommend reading the summery on the back of the box first

360,"Written by playwright Noel Coward, directed by David Lean, starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, and set to the impassioned music of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2, this is a story about two people living quietly dull lives, married to equally dull spouses, who suddenly find someone interesting to share a brief encounter with. This masterful film shows how hungry normal, ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting, and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with. The normal avenue for such a relationship would have been their own spouses; but they are unable to find it there, somehow. So they find it one day, accidentally, illicitly, secretly, dishonestly, soul wrenchingly in a stranger. Now these quietly dull souls become quietly desperate souls, as they realize that stolen love comes with a price, and that what had promised to bring them boundless happiness is instead bringing them more sorrow than they have ever known before.
 
 I found many parallels in this movie with other quietly desperate people that I know: friends of mine who have tried to find happiness illicitly, secretly, dishonestly in work, sex, alcohol, drugs, co-dependent relationships, etc. I think this movie has a powerful message for our times. It is not about a love relationship that was doomed because of a stricter social and moral code than we have today; it is about the emptiness and madness of stolen love of any kind. I love the way the film ends, with repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation. This film is a timeless gem.

361,"The last song in it was not written by Rodgers and Hart.  It was I think written by Roger Edens (of Judy Garland fame?), and is a mediocre imitation of Hartesque rhymes, at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start.  Several of the songs from the stage show were left out, as were all the verses.  Extra lyrics (not by Hart) were added to ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World"" for Durante to sing and Martha's Raye's ""The Circus Is On Parade.""  Songs from other R&H shows were interpolated.  Did someone high up like god know better than R&H what songs should be in a R&H show?  Finally, and absolutely humiliating for Martha Raye and I suspect Doris Day had a hand in it but maybe not, the line sung by Doris ""Two feet are ever cold"" is followed by Martha Raye with ""Four feet are never cold"" which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered ""I only mean to imply"" by Raye.  Goodness.  She said something wrong.  I am beginning to dislike Doris Day intensely.  She disgusts me.  The title of this shocking little song is ""Why Can't I?"" also not from the original show and with much excised.  The story (such as it is) is a predictable drag.  The DVD is cheap on Amazon (until you add postage), it's a flat $20 everywhere else + tax.  If you must, buy it from Amazon.  I wouldn't take it for free.  This is truly wholesome family entertainment, and that's about as nauseous a recommendation as I can give it.  If you like Rodgers and Hart, forget it.  Durante was in the original on stage.  I gave it 2 stars for the pretty tunes (and almost Roger Edens').

362,"WOW! that's one word that comes to mind. WOW! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air, their has not been any anime shows that have interested me. for years i searched, never finding anything worth watching. then, i sort of gave up. i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail. then one night it happened: i saw the second episode of Samurai Champloo air on adult swim. at first, i wasnt paying attention to the words and action. i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels: THE ANIMATION! the artwork was incredible!the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real. it was almost as if it was a sitcom, with real people. only tis was completly animated. it was eye-popping!then, i started to watch the show itself and the show was great!!! anyway, since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes. but alas, the last one (number seven) comes out this month on the 17th. the show is coming to an end. so anyway, im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them. i rated volume one of samurai champloo below:
 
 episode one: tempestuous temperaments- jin, mugen and fuu meet for the first time. mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three ""bad asses"" and sends some cowards to go get them. mugen however, does not know that jin has killed them already. mugen mistakes jin as one of the ""bad asses"" and attatcks him. a brilliant fight insues, and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together. 
 i rate episode one a 10/10
 
 episode two: redeye reprisal-  mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one. in this episode, the man is out for revenge. the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen. also, jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him. another great fight. and last of all, our modest (cough) fuu gets smashed.
 i rate this episode 9/10
 
 episodes 3 & 4: hellhounds for hire part one and two- the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together. jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd. mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang. fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house.
 i give both episodes 3&4 10/10
 
 thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo.
 if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes. i will say this, they are really expensive. but they are worth the money. i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it. if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not, i reccomend you buy it. i can personally vouch for this dvd. of course, its always good to check other reviews by different people as well. 
 later.
 i hope this review helped

363,"I bought all of these 6 DVDs separately because I did not know that they came as a set, at a better price! I paid about $15 each, about $90 total, and I do not regret owning them all, but I would have jumped on this set if I had known about it!
 
 Most of these DVDs are very interesting and faithful to Scripture. SAMSON & DELILAH is the weakest of these 6 DVDs, as it spends too much time on non-scriptural characters. ABRAHAM covers many scenes of the 40 year wandering rarely seen on DVD. JACOB is pretty close to Scripture. JOSEPH is great, but it spends a bit too much time rewriting the narration to allow for Ben Kingsley's Potiphar role to expand. I have not yet watched DAVID, but I look forward to Leonard Nimoy's appearance in the film.
 
 Most of these films are 3 hours long, presumably they were mostly all short mini-series when they originally ran on TV. I think only JACOB is about 90 minutes, of the 6 DVDs in this set. You can read about each DVD as they are all sold separately on amazon.com.
 
 All of these 6 DVDs have major TV network, made-for-TV quality, and I am quite surprised and pleased that these movies are so good. I do not know of any better series of Bible stories on DVD.
 
 There is another Box Set available, THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which has 3 other DVDs of this series of movies. JEREMIAH is my favorite of all 9 movies. ESTHER is great, and perhaps the most faithful to Scriptural accuracy and chronology of all 9 movies. SOLOMON is the only 3 hour DVD in this smaller Box Set. There is a GENESIS in this Box Set, but it is not a dramatized movie, just a narration of the book of Genesis, while modern day nomads are shown going about their daily routine. GENESIS is a disappointment and very UNLIKE the other 9 movies, so much so that it doesn't even seem to be part of the same production series.
 
 Bottom Line: I highly recommend that anybody buy both of these box sets, and they will save about 50% over buying each DVD separately! Praise the LORD

The story is well developed and well written and unlike ""Antz"" we are here spared pseudo political messages and this is good since the movie is after all made for children and not adults. One important message that is sent is to children is to tollerate different people and not to judge people. The music is splendid and the dialogue is right on the money. Highly recommended indeed

I am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers. After doing a little research, I found a little known fact that it was Brainy Baby that created the first set of ""infant-preschool"" videos over 10 years ago (way before the Einstein series). So, that really gave me confidence that the producers at Brainy Baby really had the experience and track record. My advice, I don't see how you could go wrong for a mere $15 investment in your child's future. I own all of them and wish Brainy Baby would make more!

366,"No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...

368,"This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a ""I know what kind of person you really are"" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.  Great film....

372,"Crackerjack suspense yarn by Kurosawa based on the novel KING'S RANSOM by Ed McBain. Toshiro Mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product (shoes) for a bigger profit; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe. 
 
 But then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded, only it turns out to be NOT his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time, his chauffeur's son. He's faced with a moral dilemma: should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially, or not? He decides to pay and get the boy back; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper. 
 
 At this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural. The kidnapper's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer. Mifune is ruined at the end, but public support is behind him. It's a great crime drama; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit. What I found most fascinating was how differently the Japanese police handled the case from the way American police might - so much more compassionately. Definitely worth a watch

375,"Yes, I am an Adam Sandler fan, but I'm not obsessed about him as some of his other fans are. I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad. 
 
 Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name.
 
 I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish like Billy Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES.

378,"My take is that this is Dudley's best movie, better than both ""Authurs"". While funny, risque and cute for the collective conscious of the late '70s, the scene sequences appear rather hackneyed and pale in the 2000s. The plot is mediocre. The greatness of the movie lay in Dudley Moores registration of wit shown by his mercurical, elegant and moving use of facial expressions and repartee with Brian Denehey at the bar and especially at the piano, revealing both great depth of feeling and consumate artistry as a musician. This piano scene, alone reason for 5 stars, was the saving grace.

379,"This is an awesome mid 80's teen movie, with a name that really doesn't match the film.

Janie and Jeff are paired up as partners for the finals, they have friction which develops into good chemistry.  This is such an amazing 80's teen flick.  It also features Shannon Dougherty as Jeff's little sister, Holly Gagnier (the old Cassie from One Life To Live), and Jonathen Silverman (Single Guy, Gimme A Break).  The DVD doesn't include any extras to my knowledge but it does give you the option to view it in full screen or wide screen version, which I thought was pretty cool.  This is a real feel good movie! It really has nothing to do with the song though, and when the song is played in the movie, It's not Cyndi Lauper singing!  It was the 80's and this was after Footloose, Flash Dance, Breakin', and maybe Slam Dance, not sure about that last one, but maybe they thought it would be good not to have the dance theme related to the title, but this is totally a movie about a big dance contest and there are several dance scenes, practices, and lots of other teen angst moments (Jeff's father wanting him to go to trade school , Jeff's sister's insecururities, Janie's strict father, the spoiled enemy chick) sprinkled throughout the film.

To all the intellectually enlighted who gave it positive and glowing reviews, I can only say you must also like Yoko Ono music and abstract art.  This is not a war movie or a social commentary whatsoever, it's garbage.  I read the book years ago and thought the book was kinda' goofy, but the movie's off-the-chart bad.  If you want to watch a kid have sex with ladies, watch people vomit, watch the seemingly constant need to urinate in glorious color just about everywhere every five minutes, and listen to a kid scream a lot for no apparent reason, then get his father killed, also seemingly for no good reason, this is your movie.  Oh, and let's not forget the decapitated horse head filled with eels - man, coulda' lived without that image all day.  Overall, WORST MOVIE EVER MADE DEALING WITH THE THIRD REICH.

 The movie was also an interesting discussion on morality. Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man. 
 
 The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas. There was also the family dynamic; his brother was willing to put Danila's life in danger. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
 
 Overall, the movie was entertaining. It was heavy, but with a few lighter spots so the viewer doesn't get overwhelmed.

386,"Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous ""raunch"" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.
 
 I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like ""This movie is just like Out Cold"".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, ""Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca"", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some ""characters"" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.
 
 If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire ""King of the Mountain"" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short. 
 
 Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the ""cut & paste"" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.

387,"Eleven years old when his father, architect Louis Kahn, died in 1974, filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn sets out in search of the man he hardly knew by visiting the sites of his architectural creations, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, to the capitol building of Bangladesh. Along the way, through interviews, old footage and photographs, much is revealed about this elusive, enigmatic, and often difficult man - including a closely guarded private life with children by three different women, while remaining married to only one of them.
 
 A personal film documenting the life and career of a public man, ""My Architect"" is wonderfully engaging, leaving the viewer with a complexity of emotions as we listen to the comments of those who admired him, those who loved him, and those who did neither. Especially revealing are the interviews with the two women, colleagues in his firm, who became romantically involved with him and years later still treasure the memory of him. An architect in Bangladesh sums up the final image of a man whose work was inspired by a kind of mystical genius and who gave his love to mankind.
 
 Moods mix and shift gracefully in the film from the discomfort of seeming to disagree with his mother's reverent estimation of the man to the sweeping effects of time-lapse photography and a whimsical scene of rollerblading around the great courtyard of the Salk Institute. Included in the DVD is an interesting and informative question and answer period between the filmmaker and a small theater audience, with additional scenes not used in the film.

 There is lots of variations in movements and music so it's kept fresh and interesting.  For once I found the cuing very very precise and right on time.  The instructor, Alison Davis, not only cues well to let you know what's coming up, but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique.  The mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and I've found results already.  It's a little over 50 minutes all up, and all you need is two sets of dumbbells.  It's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level.

 If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story.

396,"""Reefer Madness"" (originally ""Tell Your Children"") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.
 
 Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:
  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street
  - playing the piano too fast
  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much
  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well
  - having no recollection of being framed for murder
 
 If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch ""Reefer Madness"" because if we don't heed its warning, ""Reefer Madness 2"" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU

Shaft is a classic screen character.  It's unfortunate that ""Shaft"" is not a classic film.  That can be attributed to a ho-hum storyline involving a Harlem kingpin hiring Shaft to free his kidnapped daughter from Mafia thugs.

401,"This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!
 
 This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.
 
 This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. ""But just how 'black' is he?,"" you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:
 
 1. He talks different from the whites. (""Hey Bodee."" ""His name's Bodhi!"" ""Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine."" Or something to that effect.)
 
 2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)
 
 3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)
 
 4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)
 
 I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.
 
 
 The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.
 
 This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual. 
 
 Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. ""Sphere of longiness""? Ech!
 
 I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the ""I love the 80's"" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.
 
 And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.
 
 I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, ""Prayer of the Rollerboys"" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.
 
 Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect

402,"I recently rented this movie, having never seen it before.  I'm wondering what all the kudo's were for.  Denuve was pretty and had a boyfriend who was interested in her.  Why did she lock herself in that ratty apartment?  Did she have a history of mental illness?  If she didn't like being alone why didn't she go with her sister or visit her parents for the weekend.  We're never told.  I was confused and bored.  What a let down

403,"""Problem Child"" has made my top ten worst movies list.  How could anybody enjoy it?
 
 ""Problem Child"" paved the way for Little Monster movies.  In its footsteps would come ""Clifford,"" ""The Good Son"" and more recently, ""Are We There Yet?""  In this genre, children are little sadistic monsters who stop just short of killing their adult supervisors and cackle maniacally.  Usually, these movies are billed as ""comedies.""  In this one, this kid could have a tea party with Damien from ""The Omen"" and Samarra from ""The Ring.""  He's not funny, he's not charming or cute; he's a scary little creature.
 
 Plus, are we supposed to think it's funny that his idol is a serial killer?  That he writes letters to him?  That the serial killer comes to visit and ""takes him away,"" therefore putting him in danger?  That the father proves himself at the end by battling the killer and rescuing the kid?
 
 Horrible, cringe-inducing stuff.  The filmmakers should have had a long discussion before making ""Problem Child.

404,"""Deception"" is the edited version of ""Ruby Cairo,"" which is not a great movie but which is better than this one.  It isn't just the sex scene that was edited out, but a total of about 20 minutes.  The movie makes more sense in the RC version, and the sex scene, though dark and in Andie's case a bit airbrushed, is worth seeing, especially if you are a Viggo Mortensen fan.  I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely.  The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman.  It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way.  There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters. He looks about 10 years younger than she does, even with a beard

405,"Don't buy this.  Seriously.  Someone is bound to release a better version.  This is PAN AND SCAN, cropped at 1:33, and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape...Like a 3/4 inch VHS.  There are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film. And no it's NOT the print.  The film is fine.  It's the transfer.  cheap, cheap, cheap.
 
 The compression is abysmal (notice the obvious scan lines on the titles) and the sound is piss poor.  How is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the US?  Disgraceful

406,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!
 
 Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it ""digital transfer"" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.
 
 I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.
 
 The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing.

407,"Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she says, ""What does it mean? It makes no sense."" 
 
 Although there is still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The very title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya ""must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people."" Nor is it true that ""the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his redemption."" Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding words: ""Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, damnation and salvation."" BTW, the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE her hand that's gripping the bow. 
 
 With one exception, the acting is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that only this role has ""teeth""; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only his role required a ""special effect"" (his morphing back to Agnar, which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the film, knew was coming). 
 
 Other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable ""ships."" Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or 21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control of its locking device. How convenient. 
 
 The costumes are also anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top. 
 
 Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu, two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics; Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen, stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo, seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer. 
 
 Oh, one more thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views from hiding, far-far-far away

410,"Look, I am NOT a dancer.  And I am a classical, not a salsa musician.  However, I found the disk quite entertaining and helpful.  Gigi and Pedro do not come across as so elegant and skilled that it seems impossible for the average person to copy.  Yes, both know what they are doing and are quite fluent in what they communicate.  
 
 The instruction on the disk allows you to watch their whole demonstration from beginning to end or go through each set of steps and turns lesson by lesson.  You also have THREE choices of camera angle.  The default is from in front.  You can also choose looking down from above, or from the back.  This multi-view method allows you to see things in the dance that a simple 2D presentation from the front actually hides.
 
 The names of the steps are given in Spanish, but even if you don't speak the language you will pick up on the names quickly; it is not hard.
 
 I did miss the discussion of how to communicate dance steps through hand motions that I have seen in another salsa series.  One isn't going to call out the names of the steps as Gigi and Pedro do throughout these disks.  It is the subtle way one moves the hands and touches the partner that communicate what is to be done next and that is as much a part of learning the dance as the footwork.
 
 Still, a pretty darn good set of instructional disks

411,"Though based on the famous character in Phil Silver's famous oldie TV show, the new ""Sergeant Bilko"" is less an homage to that show than it is to the classic Steve Martin of his 1970's days. Though this Bilko (again a shifty and tireless grafter, the evil face of non-coms everywhere) is very much the opportunist that Silvers' character was (he runs the base casino), as shy of risk as Silvers was (the unit's mobilization orders for Desert Storm mysteriously disappeared) and manages to get caught in his own dealings as Silvers had (Bilko botches the fixing of an Army boxing match, unwittingly tricking each boxer to think he's the one who's supposed to take a fall) the screwball zaniness is very much out of Steve Martin's SNL days. 
 
 The script has Bilko's unit charged with testing a brand new army weapon - a ""hovertank"" that is soon to be cancelled because, among other things, it simply doesn't work. That the hovertank's end will spell doom for his own cozy position doesn't seem to bother Bilko, mostly because he lives day-to-day. Things change when the officer charged with evaluating the hovertank turns out to be the fearsome Major Thorn (Phil Hartman).  Years earlier, Bilko unwittingly made an enemy of Thorn by accidentally implicating him in one of his bitched schemes. Now a major, Thorne isn't simply content enough to eliminate the Hovertank, but must now axe Bilko as well. They say that desperate times reveal the man, and Bilko is now revealed to be the spineless weasel his troops have come to love. Martin plays Bilko like a character from one of his old SNL skits. It's sort of fun to watch the guy work on material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen (""LA Story"", ""Roxanne"") and more mature dramatic roles (""The Spanish Prisoner"", ""Grand Canyon"" and that update of ""Silas Marner""). It's light and breezy and you'll probably forget most of the gags, and the script under-uses most of the supporting cast (especially the now late-great Phil Hartman as Bilko's evil nemesis), but it's still fun

412,"Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man. 
 
 The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: ""It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.""
 
 Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two. 
 
 If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.

413,"I watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter, and regretted it about 10 minutes in.  After reading Queen Bees & Wannabees, I can't help but despair whenever I look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world.  
 
 In Barbie's envisioning of this world the central theme is to ""be yourself"", but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping, chasing each others' boyfriends, inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football, and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star.  While I realize that this is teenage girl reality, is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint?
 
 The popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls, so it's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the ""popular lawn"" is really clear, other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing.  But at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it's like to be on the outside looking in.
 
 Of course, there's the ""magic diary"" aspect of the story, which seemed the only tie to the ""other"" Barbie world (Fairytopia, Mermadia, et all).  I realized then what I was really watching...a marketing cry for help from Mattel.  The target demo for Barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls, and they're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like Bratz are chipping away at.  I promptly dumped all Mattel stock from my 401k.

414,"Here's a memorable Oscar-winning performance from one of Hollywood's finest actor's, Ronald Colman, in a story of jealousy, madness and revenge.  In a role that was originally intended for Cary Grant, Colman is excellent as Anthony John, a celebrated off-Broadway actor who blurs the line between his character, Othello, and reality when he starts acting on the murderous impulses of his character.  As a psychological melodrama, ""A Double Life"" undoubtedly stands out as a success. 
 
 George Kukor's direction is exemplary as he successfully juxtaposes Tony John's real jealousy over his ex-wife's relationship with Edmond O'Brien, while mirroring the wracked emotions and madness of Shakespeare's protagonist. 
 
 Colman convincingly protrays Tony John's progressive dementia from the get-go the minute he is offered the part soon after the opening credits roll. For an actor used to playing debonair and  swashbuckling heroes in the 30's this role must have been a challenge for Colman, but a welcome one.  He brings a nervous intensity to the character of Tony John that is never melodramatic but is realistically portrayed. 
 
 Co-written by the talented actress, Ruth Gordon (Harold & Maude), ""A Double Life"" showcases an impressive cast including Shelley Winters (in her first professional role), Ray Collins, and Signe Hasso. 
 
 The score by Miklos Rozsa, as well as the screenplay by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, are both as memorable as the performances in this remarkable film. This DVD's transfer is markedly clean and lovingly restored from the original film negative and presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the the film was initially shot.

Larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head, but end up doubling you over with laughter. His preformance will definitely torque your brain, so be prepared. There are a couple instances where Larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure. One such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun. I was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that Larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don't fart, they don't even have buttholes. He then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out EVER. Unless you are an idiot, you know you can't look like him without a strict training regiment, nice try Larry.

421,"Okay, I've discovered the Worst Director Ever, bar none.  I've watched three of Hollywood b-movie veteran director Jean Yarbrough  recently (THE BRUTE MAN, THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG, and now HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE) and this is one bad-nasty awful director.  OTHG was a criminal waste of a veteran cast of character actors heading rapidly towards the sunset.  BRUTE MAN was exploitation unleavened with insight or humanity.  HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE is hick humor for those who find Don Knotts' movies too difficult to follow.  These films are monuments to blown opportunities, stagnant and unimaginative direction, comedy that makes us groan and horror that makes us laugh.  
   Avoid the scenes with Basil Rathbone if at all possible.  It's apparent he'd suffered a stroke prior to this movie and his distinct enunciation is noticeably slurred, making it difficult for a fan to watch.  About the only highlights here are when the country music stars (Ferlin Husky and Merle Haggard, especially) strap on the guitars and sing.

423,"Opinions are like noses: everyone has one. Some like it, some don't. Let me say this, however, in defense of this 1980 movie starring Robin Williams as Popeye. It is certainly unfair to say, by any stretch, that this is 'the worst movie of all-time', or 'one of the worst...'. It is funny how, at the time of this writing, that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars...Actually that is about right. For those who do not know about the wonderful website called The Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), you really need to check it out. [...] My point is this: There are many opinions. So if you have never seen this movie, decide for yourself. Do you remember the incredible muttering Popeye (done by Jack Mercer on the cartoons)?. I'm talking especially about the early Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons from the 30's. You know, the ones in black-and-white. That's what I loved the most, the muttering Popeye. Well, Robin Williams does it superbly! Also, Shelly Duvall is excellent as Olive Oyl in this movie. Granted, the story is kind of bland. The music is not always top notch. Yes, it is too long. However, I enjoyed watching Robin Williams' masterful portrayal of everyone's favorite Sailor Man. Sure, Olive can get a little annoying at times, but wasn't she basically that way in the cartoons? So if you loved the muttering Popeye, then you'll love the movie, overall. Never mind the story. The storyline doesn't really matter, I feel. But, alas, you say you cannot really remember those vintage Popeye cartoon shorts too well. Not to worry! They are scheduled to be released on DVD... FULLY RESTORED!!! Volume 1 (1933 - 1938), with a July 2007 scheduled release, will have, in my opinion, the very best of all the 230 total Popeye cartoon shorts. (Incidently, William Costello provided Popeye's voice from 1933 until sometime in 1935. He was very good also, but the really GREAT muttering came when Jack Mercer took over in 1935). By all means, if you are a huge Popeye fan like myself, then you absolutely must get these DVDs. After listening to the great Jack Mercer, and watching the incredible animation in those early years, then compare Popeye to Robin Williams' version. I dare say, you will see the similarity. So, the bottom line is: See for yourself. If you love Popeye, the character, then you will not be disappointed with Robin Williams' performance. The movie itself... well, you be the judge. Likely you have a nose, so without a doubt you, too will have an opinion. It's ALL alright.

427,"Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another ""sick"" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).
 It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: ""Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it."" That's the moral of the story, really.

445,"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ""ruined"" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.
 
 Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).
 
 Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see

447,"The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film.  I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie.  I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ... ""why""?  Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit.  There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation.  Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending.  It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution.  Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved.  This was my biggest issue with this film.  The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine ""ripple-effect"" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result. 
 
 Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film.  I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it.  It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all.  Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed.  Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent.  She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time.  She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement.  It nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister.  She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention?  That was confusing and completely random.  Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent.  Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything.  The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud.  I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally ""poofed"" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama.  It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts).  Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was nearly a ""cut-and-paste"" character used to strengthen an already weakened story.  Don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story.  Again using the ""cut-and-paste"" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to.  It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ... but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood.  Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.  
 
 The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble.  There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to Grandma about.  More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation.  What may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me.  Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ... eeewwww).  Also, she wore the same dress everyday.  That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television.  Sex and dirty laundry.  Now there is a great film for you!  There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish.  Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.
 
 Overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful.  I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation.  I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation.  Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used.  If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ... then, maybe this film is for you!

448,"I am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival, and I have to agree with anybody that says this movie is [...]. The whole cast is wasted in this movie, and most of which I have seen in movies that I liked better. Like pretty much the leads in this movies, I have seen thier movies and liked htem better in, but this one, they might as well. If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs. Here are 99 minuts of my life, that I won't see again, and I am trying to make sure that you don't waste your time on this dud. Who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog, in some scenes in the movie, ore pretty much the whole thing. I haven't seen Monster House or Cars, but I hope that these will be 2 better movies, or maybe a season dvd of Home Improvement will be pretty then this. Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant & Strictland. And he doesn't much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh's PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.

449,"The last time I saw the names ""Adam Goldberg"" and ""Giovanni Ribisi"" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan.
 
 Goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long.  At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to ""Memento"" or something of that nature.  What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution.  Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning.  Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey.
 
 Rabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble.  Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him.  Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him.  Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales.  We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring.  The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all.  The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat.

I hope the director's family (he died in 1970) is simply holding back the original masters in hopes of making a deal for an authorized DVD version.  ""The Red Balloon"" is such a wonderful little movie -- perhaps the best introduction to the cinema for any child -- but it is almost destroyed by the condition of the source used for this transfer.  Can't we have a version that matches the film's vision for its 50th anniversary

453,"The Anthology is a very good collection of 3 live shows from Bruce Dickinson's, pulled from many sources.  DVD ONE has Tattoo Millionaire tour live footage (DIVE DIVE DIVE), and Skunkworks Live. The DIVE video is poor quality shots, and the sound is not the greatest.  My favorite is the Skunkworks footage.  That album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden.  It's good to the footage done when it was still fresh, and laugh at Bruce trying to be ""alternative"".
    Disc two is just Scream for Me Brazil in yet another package.  Good song set, playing Bruce's best solo work ever (Chemical Wedding Material), but it's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens.  Pretty disapointing disc, could have been left out, made the package cost less, and no one would have missed it.  This keeps this DVD from getting 5 Stars  
    Disc three is the cool best part of this package.  The promo videos are just nice to have in one spot. The Tyranny of Souls promo video is interesting, and where else are you going to find the Samson footage.  All of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video (like knowing the ""Tatooed Millionaire"" video was directed by the pink floyd ""Learning to Fly"" directory...now the connection is made).  Nice job with the last disc.
    Overall, I feel the skunkworks video and the Promo material are the best parts of this collection, and make it worth the 10 dollars I paid for this.  I would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection, because the bulk of these DVD's is filler on disc two, and I would feel ripped off by it.  
    If you have been a long time maiden/dickinson fan, get this anyway.

455,"This is an illuminating glimpse into the music and song craft of The Band.  Composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer John Simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording ""The Band"".
 
 This one is for music lovers.  Many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio, with John Simon, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix.  Absolutely fascinating stuff.  Having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years, it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated, with insightful commentary from the artists who created it.
 
 Also fascinating, in more of a train wreck kind of a way, was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.  Both brilliant artists, but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of The Band's fame.  Rick's remarks on the loss of his best friend Richard Manuel left me with chills, knowing that not too many more months from this interview and Rick would be gone from this place as well.

464,"I could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about. Or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film, and find out that way. Most of you probably know it by now, as it is. A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a ""blockbuster"" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a ""blockbuster"". But it's also a damn good story, as  mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous ""You can't handle the truth...."" line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this.

467,"One good thing about this movie is that it helped me find religion.  It was so bad that I actually wrote a prayer:  Oh great and loving God, take mercy upon this, the lowliest of your creatures.  Burn my brain, I beseech thee... yeah with fire, acid, turpentine, and super-hot hot sauce lay waste to the portion of my brain which remembers having viewed ""Point Blank"" with Mickey Rourke!  Keep me safe and guide my steps far, far from future viewings, so that in thy mercy I might instead feast upon broken glass and burning hot lava, and smear my naked buttox with honey and lay me upon a hill of ants rather than ever see this film again.  Amen.
 
 Like many of you, I first came across this little gem while searching for the 1967 masterpiece of funkadelic nihilism starring Lee Marvin.  Well, of course THAT'S not out of DVD yet, but since I'm a huge fan of Mickey Rourke (for reasons which, as his career progresses, I find more and more difficult to remember), I thought ""Wow, Mickey Rourke just re-made one of the coolest movies of all time... might be worth watching.""  Boy, was THAT a mistake!
 
 First of all, this IS NOT a remake of Lee Marvin/John Boorman's Point Blank.  That's two strikes against Rourke, because he ALSO starred in ""Bullet,"" a stupid piece of crap which had nothing to do with Steve McQueen's ""Bullit,"" another of the great guy films of all time.  It's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and Mickey Rourke Kills them.  'Nuff said re the plot.
 
 One thing that really sticks out about this film is that Rourke, typically a pretty muscular dude, is positively STEROIDAL!  I mean, he put on SO MUCH muscle for this role that his skin literally looks as if it's going to fissure and peel off!  I don't know what he was on, but it must be something we normally use on farm animals

468,"Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of ""heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,"" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see.

471,"First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying ""Jaws"" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by ""Jaws 4- The Revenge,"" in being worse. ""III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more ""made for TV,"" as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, ""Yeah, right!"", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning ""Officer and a Gentleman"" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of ""Jaws.

474,"As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.
 
 Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: ""OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters,"" and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.
 
 I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt ""1984."" That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single ""Big Brother is Watching You."" Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, ""Kill the pig, spill her blood!"" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, ""We killed a pig."" That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, ""KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!"" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to ""Tell me about the rabbits, George.""
 
 On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when ""something something"" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.
 
 This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion

475,"This movie is strickly for the women now I see why it was made for the lifetime channel. It was hard for me(as a man)  to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters.  I was looking for a happy ending and didn't get it.

476,"The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to ""tighty-whities.""  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one

477,"Who wrote this movie? That is the first thing I had to ask myself after watching this movie a couple of months ago. Oddly enough, this movie was one of my favorite ""scary"" films to watch as a little boy...but, as an adult, WOW...this is just BAD. The original Jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second, although not as deep or well paced, is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline. This movie, on the other hand, is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover...at sea world! Who would ever think to incorporate SEA WORLD into the Jaws franchise??? Seriously, It was just a horrible idea! The whole, ""Mother Shark lost her baby shark"" scenario is just weird...I don't even think that Shark's raise there ""pups"" once they are born...they just swim away. Not that this is that much different than the plot in Jaws 2, where a ""relative"" shark of the first Jaws decides to go after Cheif Brody and his kids...cheesy, but still, more fun and overall a better storyline. This movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-D graphics add a overly grainy, aged look to the film. The acting is horrendous. Dennis Quaid is OK, but everyone else is just plain awful. Also, who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass? Who OK'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark's nose hitting it 3 times??? That's not too safe in my opinion. This is just a bad, bad movie. There isn't much that I can say is GOOD about it...but, I will give it 2 stars because it entertained me when i was a little boy and for that i am thankful

478,"As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.
 
 I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream...

480,"I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging

482,"I liked Vin Diesel despite Riddick and thought that he can be a good action star.

483,"Reading these reviews, I was surprised by a number of the comments but most of all by those that rented/bought this movie believing it was somehow about ""angels"" and then had the nerve to complain that they didn't know what it was about or that there were no angels in the movie.
 
 With that in mind, I'd like to offer some advice to those that may inadvertently rent/buy other movies:
 
 There are no Cuckoo birds and no nests in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
 There is no obvious wind in Gone With the Wind and what there was didn't blow anything away
 There are few, if any, good fellas in Goodfellas
 There are no lambs in Silence of the Lambs
 Chinatown isn't set in a town in China
 There is neither $1,000,000 nor a baby in Million Dollar Baby
 You guessed it, no bulls in Raging Bull
 The coats are made of denim or some such material in Full Metal Jacket
 Paul Newman's body temperature is about 98.6 degrees just like the rest of us in Cool Hand Luke
 There is little, if any, sleeping in The Big Sleep
 The prison hallway is only a few feet long in The Green Mile
 The African Queen is not about a gay black man
 No waterfowl were hurt in the making of Duck Soup
 The earth rotated as usual on the Day the Earth Stood Still
 There are actually multiple conversations in The Conversation
 The raunchy men's magazine does not appear in The Hustler
 Nobody inherited the wind in Inherit the Wind. It still belongs to all of us
 There is no discernible odor while watching The Sweet Smell of Success
 All the President's Men is only about *some* of the president's men
 
 I hope that some will find these simple reminders useful. If not, you may want to consider looking at the back of a DVD case, visiting your local library or going to one of the thousands of web sites that talk about every movie ever made.
 
 As for this film, if you're not frightened by things that might be different than what you've experienced or that perhaps strike too close to home, and don't spend your time judging how everyone else lives, then there is much to love about this work. It may not be perfect, and there can be many legitimate gripes about it, but overall it's very, very good. Scan through the positive reviews here and you'll get a good sense of it. No need for me to repeat it all here. Unfortunately, most (but not all) of the negative reviews are just those with some sort of political/religious agenda to put forth instead of commenting on the film

484,"I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..

486,"What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?
 
 To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.
 
 But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.
 
 But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable. 
 
 After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.
 
 To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel

487,"Hello
 I won't sell you on the show-it's one of my favorites, and you can read other's opinions there.  What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player.  So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable.  It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all.  We don't have this problem with ANY other movies.  SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK.  All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP.  What a shame. 
 GOOD LUCK

488,"This film is about a young porn star who of course had tragedy in her life.  When she was 12 her mother committed suicide.  After her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops Parkinson's Disease.  At 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life.  She juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by Rosario Dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher.  I really enjoyed this film but couldn't help but feel like the actress who portrayed Moon was doing her best Angelina Jolie impersonation, I mean she had Angelina down pat.  James Wood deserves an Oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down. I enjoyed this film, but like many other films I was frustrated with the story at times.  It seemed to be all over the place sometimes.  I never knew if the love story between Moon and her blind date was going anywhere, then we see Mon venture off into a new business, then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis'.  Although it was all over the place at times, it was a great little indy film, the best indy film I have seen since ""Secretary.

491,"Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. 
 
 Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.
 
 The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.
 
 For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.

496,"Spoilers ahead:
 I am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies, and totally enjoy a good B flick. But I have to say that this one was just terrible. There's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever, I just couldn't believe how stupid the main character really was!!
 How do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you? I mean come on!!! Breaking into the rangers office on site, no less, and getting drunk...all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her? Then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho. Was no one else shouting at the screen ""Grab the cop's gun and shoot the psycho!"" as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike. 
 And running infront of the truck, in the headlights... There was forest all around her and she never once went and hid, just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom. A sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it's misery in my opinion.
 No, it was simply unbelievable and I was relieved when the credits rolled. So glad I didn't actually pay the rental fee on this one

497,"I found this video to be a real snoozer. While the title ""My first time"" suggests a sexy look at guy's first experiences, nothing could be farther from the truth.  This video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases.  While it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid, if I knew that sex ed is what this video preached about (i.e. how to use a condom), I would have passed.  This video is produced in England, and for an American, the accents can be distracting.  My recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex, get this video.  If you know the ropes, pass on this one
