0,"There is nothing redeeming about this movie. No. I'm sorry. There's no negotiating with that. I don't care if I come back and see ""0 of 2,000 people have found this review helpful"" I won't change my opinion. This movie is just flat out BAD! Why is it so bad? I could write a book on it, but I can sum it all up by simply saying it is your typical disaster film. It follows every single cliche in the book. And I don't mean fun cliche like horror movies, I mean like you know what's going to happen the entire movie five minutes in. 
 
 1. Natural disaster of ludicrous proportions hits America. No other nation is affected, of course, or if they are only to a slight degree.
 2. Government leaders go, ""OMFG WTF?"" and try to prevent it. Initial destruction is prevented by blocking up the storyline with subplots.
 3. Some cockamany idea to stop the disaster is attempted. It works...
 4. ...for about five seconds. Then real disaster hits and millions die. Let's think seriously here: how many mega natural disasters have befallen major American cities? Like serious disasters? I can think of two: San Francisco in the early 1900's and recently New Orleans. Yet somehow in movies when a natural disaster hits, it ALWAYS hits a highly populated area.
 
 There's loads more cliches - hell, a section in Part Two concerning people escaping a destroyed casino is basically a thirty minute ""Poseidon's Adventure."" With such ingenuity, you wouldn't expect too much character development, would you? I hope not, because this movie has the most typical assortment of characters you'll ever find:
 
 * The government official who tells other characters what's going on and shoots people worried looks.
 * The typical government leader (in this case, the president) who mostly does yelling and pity-playing 
 * The feisty, independent daughter who has a coming of age moment - and who by the way, happens to be the president's daughter and happens to get her father to ask the Secret Service to leave her alone. Um...the president doesn't even have the power to tell the Secret Service to leave HIM alone.
 * The wife trapped in a building who turns out to be pregnant.
 * The two brothers who hate each other but learn to cope with one another before one of them dies.
 * The guy who yells ""I'm getting out of here!"" and gets killed upon trying to escape.
 * The worry-wort girl who is told ""You'll make it out of here"" only to die two minutes later.
 * The stubborn old folks who refuse to leave their home, even with immenant death and destruction headed their way. Why? ""This is our home!"" Your suburban house in Houston? PLEASE! Unless you're living on freggin' Indian burial grounds, don't tell me your small patch of turf is worth getting yourself killed for.
 
 You're supposed to care for these people. You're supposed to feel bad when they die. But since they're the same cookie-cutter characters you've seen a hundred times in a hundred different disaster movies, you really don't care. 
 
 But let me get to my biggest beef with this movie...WHO THE HECK DIRECTED THIS?! Lemme check IMDB...John Lafia? Hey John - DON'T EVER DIRECT AGAIN! Or if you do, here's a little advice - KEEP YOUR DAMN CAMERA STILL! Every single shot is either shaky cam or zooms. Yes, zoom. Zoom in. Zoom out. Zoom in. Zoom out. Every single shot. Doesn't matter the mood, tone, or action. Zoom in. Zoom out. It's like they didn't plan out any of the scenes and the camera man had to correct every shot. This gets old in about five minutes. No, actually, it got old in ten seconds. And considering this is a two-part miniseries, about an hour and a half long each, it's enough to have someone commit suicide.
 
 Is this movie good? No, because I've seen it already. I saw it when it was called ""Deep Impact."" I sall it when it was called ""Armaggedon."" I saw it when it was ""Dante's Peak."" I saw it when it was ""Volcano."" I saw it when it was ""Asteroid."" I saw it when it was...ARG!! My apologies for the bitter review, but this movie really tried my patience. I cannot understand how there are people out there that like this. I suppose there is a secret cult of self-mutilating masochists out there who enjoy punishing themselves by watching bad movies for their own sick, evil amusement. Then again, perhaps I hate and love this movie as much as I hate and love myself..

2,"Is that THE ROCK who is in this movie looking malnourished with the rotted teeth and sinister contact lenses make-up? This movie is horrible. But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are ""Kickboxer"" and ""Bloodsport"". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his ""acting"" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for ""Revenge of the Nerds""... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work. It's not like they weren't paid handsomely for their services

4,"This Noam Chomsky speech on DVD is, as usual, enlightening. Mr Chomsky documents the facts, the truths, and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years. This speech and the bonus interview with the Harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively ""believe"" what we are told by our government, rather than seeking to ""know"" the facts (or simply ask, ""wait, is that statement true?"").  Mr Chomsky explains patiently, that facts are important. Words and meaning cannot be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners.

5,"In ""Lassie Come Home,"" ""National Velvet,"" and ""The Courage of Lassie,"" Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ... Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production that was nominated for five Academy Awards... 
 
 As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity... Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, the young Liz dedicates herself to the prize-winning horse the way she later devotes herself to men...
 
 Anticipating her later images of young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both saintly and mature... Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.' 
 
 Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle... 
 
 From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, ""National Velvet"" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making... 
 
 Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance...
 
 The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream...
 
 Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern...

6,"The social convulsion of the seventies affected all the layers of the family; many men simply gave up and many women had to face the life with major realism and mercurial energy. The pivot in this sense might be found in the legendary cult movie of John Cassavetes: ""A woman under the influence"", but the raising of such talented actresses on stage such as Jane Fonda, Glenda Jackson, Catherine Deneuve, Rommy Schneider, Hanna Schygulla, Liv Ullman, Julie Christie, Vanessa Redgrave, Sally Field, Jill Clayburgh, Diane Keaton, or Ellen Burstyn were far to be a mere casualty; they responded to a vision of a world in crisis at different levels, emotional, affective and existential.       
 
 Jill Clayburgh (one of my everlasting favorite American actresses) will undertake the exigent task of facing her own life after his husband walks out on her.
 
 One of the top American movies of the Seventies!

7,"One mindblowing, boring saturday night I decided to watch I Know What You Did Last Summer. Oh what a choice. So I sat there and watched and watched. The first maybe 25 minutes seemed quite entertaining. But as the plot began to unravel, it seemed more clear to me that it was just like any other Scary teen movie. Yes, some parts of it were suspensful. But the movie was very pointless. Some guy chasing after some rich ass teens after they killed a guy that wasn't even related to him? And what was up with the whole costume? It was very stupid and predictable. Bassicaly this movie is good if you have nothing else to do, than waste one hour and a half of your life.

8,"This film is so sweet and whimsical.  The cultural aspects depicted in the film are what amused me the most.  The two love stories intertwined into one main plot is very well put together.  This has been my favorite film for several years now and just watching it again made me remember just how much I love it.  I highly recommend this international film for those who like to venture into other cultures for entertainment.  This is a must see! Love some of the music as well!

9,"I've adored Leahy since I stumbled across their first CD, several years ago. AFAIK, this is their first DVD, and I sincerely hope it's the first of many. The DVD presents their first broadcast show for PBS. This family puts on a wonderful show, and the music they make is beyond outstanding. They combine traditional Cape Breton and Irish/Scottish fiddling syles with updated instrumental accompaniment in a way that injects modern vitality into already wonderful traditional musical styles. And Donelle Leahy, their lead fiddler, can't really be quite human! Don't neglect to watch the ""additional performances"" section of the DVD--it was a crime to cut *any* part of this production from the broadcast

10,"Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers

11,"Miss Silverman is the most recent addition to the group of ""meta-bigot"" comedians -- i.e. comics who tell ethnic jokes supposedly for their ""shock"" value, while hiding behind a screen of supposed irony -- which includes Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, Chris Rock, and the writers of South Park. I find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the ""n"" word so much. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive, female and Jewish. If Larry the Cable guy ever said the ""n"" word on a comedy DVD, I guarantee you that Al Sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick. 
 
 Keep in mind that Silverman has been dating Jimmy Kimmel of ""The Man Show"" fame for many years. Though I am a female, I did truly enjoy The Man Show, though I thought it wasn't as ironic as many people would have you believe. Anti-PC ""irony"" is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves, and don't have the gonads to do so in public. Anyone who can appreciate humor knows there's a difference between comedy and hate, but many are so sensitive that they can't tell the difference.

12,"This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.
 
 Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's ""pet"" squirrel escape his pants to the ""bathroom"" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call ""toilet-bowl humor."" Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call ""amiable,"" ""heart-warming,"" or even ""cute""; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe ""artist"" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.
 
 Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a ""special edition"" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing

13,"I really like the story and this film brings you back to the last century and the ambiance of these times. Colin Firth is fantastic in this role!

14,"This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.
 
 I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.
 
 This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.
 
 First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.
 
 Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, ""having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return.""
 
 And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.
 
 I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel

16,"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies

17,"If you're looking for something groundbreaking like B:TAS or ""The New Batman Adventures,"" you'll have to look elsewhere. ""The Batman"" is nothing new. In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two ""hipper"" more ""kid-friendly"" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment.

20,"You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of ""Islam is a religion of peace,"" repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.   
 
 A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up. 
 
 After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the ""President wants to appear presidential."" Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a ""fascist U.S. Army general"", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).
 
 Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them! 
 
 But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for ""violating the Constitution"" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the ""fascist"" general. Ta-dah!
 
 So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.
 
 Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool. 
 
 I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book

 The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has ""deleted scenes,"" which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time. 
 
 So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.
 
 So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.

30,"My father took me to see this movie when I was a child of about six or seven.  Actually, he wanted to see it and he had to take me along.  I didn't remember the plot, but I remembered the scenery and the music and the cool biplanes and dogfights.
 
 So, I finally bought this movie so I could watch it as an adult.
 
 I can empathize with those who say this movie is too long and moves too slowly.  That said, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
 
 The airplanes are amazing.  Where did they get all these biplanes from?  The only other movie I've seen that has such authentic looking biplane dogfights is ""Wings"", and that was made back in the 1920's when biplanes were all over the place.
 
 The soundtrack by Jerry Goldmith fits the movie perfectly and adds mood where appropriate.
 
 I loved the ""intermission"".   It reminded me of a time when a movie was a real event.  Movies were so long that the movie itself gave you a break to use the bathroom.  I saw this movie in a theater that was designed to allow perhaps a thousand people to watch a single movie on a huge screen, not some modern ""plex"" theater that has twelve little rooms where you can pay to see a movie with a bunch of strangers a few months before it's out on DVD.
 
 So, it moves a little slowly by today's standards, but it's epic, and it's interesting to watch Peppard's character slowly alienate himself from his squadron, and his lover, so that at the end they kill him off by giving him the ""privelege"" of flying an experimental aircraft.

33,"While I was watching this movie there was one thing I could not get out of my head: it looks as if the script had been written by Arturo Perez-Reverte. This in itself means considerable praise for the director and screenplay writer Mateo Gil, who adapted a novel by Juan Bonilla, since Perez-Reverte is one of my favorite authors. Before discussing other aspects of the film, I must say that I did not notice any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers regarding the quality of the DVD. I am not an expert in technology, so the reason for this may be that my DVD player adapts better than others to different formats, but I really do not know.
 
 Simon Cardenas, played by Eduardo Noriega is a writer suffering from writer's block, who in the meantime works creating crosswords for a newspaper in Seville. At the start of the last Holy Week of the millennium he gets a strange message on his answering machine. The caller requests that he uses a particular word in a set place in the next crossword puzzle or there will be consequences for Simon's friends and family. The word in question is ""Adversario"", and Simon decides to play along; but this leads to a series of attacks starting with the release of Sarin, a poisonous gas, inside a church. 
 
 Simon decides to start investigating and searching for the source of the attacks, and that is how he meets Maria, the journalist that is in charge of the investigation for the newspaper. From then on, things get really interesting, when more attacks are noticed, and Simon and Maria get involved in the action. Also, Simon's roommate (Toad) starts acting weird and has some suspicious items in his possession, leading to a certain level of paranoia in Simon. Whether this is justified or not, only time can tell.
 
 An interesting script and reasonably good performances make this an enjoyable movie. If you like to discover new places, the impeccable sights of the city of Seville will give the movie and added flare. For those of you that are used to American thrillers, this film may provide a break from the norm. If you have read authors like Perez-Reverte, you know what I mean, since in the Spanish tradition, you do not always find the extremely twisted plots or the consistent happy endings you see in American films. Whether you will get these elements in this movie or not is for you to find out.

35,"Tragic"" is a word that may become synonymous with the name of Edie Sedgwick.
 
  The 5 stars are for Edie's smile, and nothing more.
 
  This ""Let's Start"", and then ""Stop"", ""Start again"" cycle of this film presents as a messy, disorganized glance at Ms. Sedgwick's disturbing life.
 
  Another 'tragedy "" exists here. Our educated culture should recognize that if Edie weren't exceptionally beautiful, there wouldn't have been much fuss over an ancestor of a historically noted family.
 
  Beauty still takes precedence over most other attributes.
  It's been over 35 years since the death of Edie Sedgwick, but the ""glam-famishished"" still won't let the beauty get her rest.
 
  The film's black and white scenes show the brilliance of Edie's past beauty, but are all cut and pasted into a confusing,tangled decoupage.
 
  The additional color footage of the next decade is woven in carelessly.  If it was just Edie's glowing wedding sequence that were included,it would've been much easier to watch.
 
   The ""two teenagers"" who appear in the  the colored segments seem out of time with Edie's Glory Days of the 60's.
 
    This is NOT  a spiraling Masterpiece.Not a work of art nor imagination galore.
 
    Just commercial trash for the star struck. For other than commercial purposes, it is a film that Spotlights it's own defeat.

 I laughed outright during the first 15 minutes, promptly dubbed it ""The Watery Tart"" [/monty python]; then fell asleep out of sheer boredom soon after, thereby missing the bulk of the film.

Some people cannot follow it, but those who do love it.  I really loved it.  It is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off, but it is really great.  This is one you have to think with and pay attention to.  This is not something to walk in and out of.  It would not make any sense at all.  Not one for kids.  They will be really confused.

41,"I've just endured an unpleasant half hour trawling through the myriad reviews of ""Grand Canyon"", that are so misinformed as to be laughable.
 
 Aside from the fact that the New York Times may have awarded this the ""worst film of all time"" (in a year that ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"" was released?? - please!) I find these attitude of such reviewers quite lamentable.  Grand Canyon is a magnificent film - and absolutlely NOT just the purview of ""New Agers""!  Anyone who has studied film to even a marginal degree will recognise the greatness in Grand Canyon. No, it's not ""The Godfather""... yet it is still one of the finest films of its time.  To those it touches (and there are many), it is unforgettable.
 
 Kasdan had a vision that was unfortunately ahead of its time (and still appears to be in 2006, judging from some of the reviews here!).  Certainly not ""The Big Chill"", Grand Canyon is a far more nuanced work - to those who understand its subtleties, it is sublime - to those still struggling to comprehend the mysteries, magic and meaning of our existance here, I can see how it might appear impenetrable or pretentious.  That is no fault of the film itself - just as ""Deuce Bigalow"" is speaking to its chosen audience of prepubertal adolescents, so is Grand Canyon attempting to connect with those humans who choose to delve beneath the flimsy facade of modern existance. To the opinion-makers, it will naturally slip under their radar; don't let that be a reason for you missing this unmissable film.
 
 To anyone considering this film, I implore you - do not be distracted by the inane ramblings of posters who wouldn't understand a truly meaningful film if they fell over it.  Grand Canyon is for a select audience - it will never be widely popular; as if that were any true marker of what is important!  Grand Canyon stands tall as one of the great achievements of the 1990s - watch it, and be moved.  Watch it, and see a reflection of the world we currently find ourselves in - striving for answers, yearning for meaning... and looking all the while for the magic that defines our existance.
 
 Absolutely five stars

42,"As with the other reviewers of this film, I must agree that
 in its restored and complete form, this is an outstanding
 film.  The supplemental material is also quite interesting.
 The themes in this film are just as relevant today as they
 were when it was made.  Most anything else I could write would
 be redundant with what others have written.
 
 I will admit that at points I felt the film dragged a bit,
 having made a point but not moving on.  Maybe I am just too
 much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today.
 
 One thing I find curious about this movie is the title.  Since
 the main character is not Colonel Blimp and is really a much
 deeper character than the cartoon character, I wonder why the
 film was given the name it was.   I wonder how many people went
 to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character.
 
 My minor quibbles aside, this is really an excellent film and
 worth seeing.

48,"This undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems.  It isn't a bad little western, and the two lead roles are played competently by Vera Miles, whose most famous role was Laurie Jorgensen in ""The Searchers,"" and Sam Elliott, who was born to make westerns.  It had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations.  
 
 Unfortunately, the film was not well shot.  None--and I mean not one--of the interior scenes is adequately lighted; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background.  The scenes in the Cactus Jail, which are key and set up the movie, might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light.  Then there's the DVD which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film.  The DVD is blurry and shows every scratch, spot, and speck of dirt that 33 years of obscurity could inflict on the print.  Too bad.  Miles and Elliott deserved better.  Frankly, because of the technical issues, the film is probably not worth wasting 90 minutes on.

52,"I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well

53,"Set in the suburbs of Tokyo, ""Whisper of the Heart"" is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one's first true love.  The teenage main character, Shizuku, wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world.  While she is a voracious reader, she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view.  After meeting a hansome boy, Seiji, who both infuriates and intrigues her, Shizuku sets a personal goal.  Because Seiji knows he wants to study violin making in Italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills, Shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer.  During the course of Whisper of the Heart, she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work, one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories.  A subplot is Shizuku's relationship with Seiji's Grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience.  He teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work.  He also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending.   
 
 Other than the scene showing Shizuku's writing, the story has none of the strange characters, magic, or fantastic settings of other Studio Ghibli U.S. releases.  (In my opinion, some of their best real-life style stories such as ""Omoide Poro Poro"" do not translate well into American culture or the American market.)  The animation is fantastic, which I attribute to the detail Studio Ghibli includes.  This is the film which gave rise to ""The Cat's Return"" and several of the characters are found in both (the Baron, Muuta).
 
 Regardless of the subject matter, I was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling.  My wife and I often set the language to Japanese with subtitles (my Japanese is abysmal) and as we found with ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" the translation of the Japanese dialog is better than what was written for the English version.  Those with some knowledge of Japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story.  These include studying for the High School admission tests and the ""Goodbyes"" of long-time classmates following junior high school.  I found this to be a good family movie and highly recommend it, particularly to anyone with teenage daughters.

54,"This could have been a 5 star movie because it is hard for me to follow the dialect without subtitles though the acting by the cast was what made up for this.  The cinematography is great and was sentimental seeing the coast of Cornwall.  I saw this movie primarily cause of Imogen Stubbs playing the part of a tomboy as being plausable because of a boyish figure like Hilary Swank, who is a hotty too.  I found Imogen attractive in other roles and was curious as to how i would see her.  Well it was amusing to watch the scenes where her cover could have been revealed whether or not she was fooling anyone i could not care cause she still looked fine as a woman to me.  One particular time was when an instructor was correcting her posture during fencing training at the military academy.  Later I enjoyed her swordsmanship in a duel that was surprisingly aggressive so that you would not mind having her around alot enjoying life. There is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that Imogen had part into that is worth noting

55,"I must agree with a few others on here that I was disappointed with this version of 'Peter Pan'. 
 
 PROS:
 -Cathy Rigby's skill as an olympic gymnast really gave Peter a great element of athleticism. Great voice and fun actress.
 -Scenic design and set design all really nicely done, a bit predictable, but predictable is what an audience wants to see when they to to a production of 'Peter Pan'
 
 CONS:
 -The cuts! Like others have said, this production is totally rushed and they made some weird cuts.
 -The face value acting doesn't go deep enough into the characters. While all these performers are skilled individuals, I was not impressed with their acting. However, this could be partially the fault of the director as well.
 -The lip synching was a huuuuuuge disappointment!
 -I don't understand what the deal is with the adults playing lost boys. Yes, adult performers can often perform more sophisticated choreography, but a certain nostalgia and innocence is brought to the production when actual kids are invovled.
 
 With all that said, I think that kids would love this video. However, as a musical theatre student there are several shortcomings to this production overall. Nice musical, so-so interpretation. :

Part of one can be seen in the trailer. Nothing was taken out that will muddy the plot. But I have to ask Miramax, why, at a short 90 minutes, would you bother taking out more of the fun? And I truly have a dislike for the voiceovers done to change Aussie references to American. Don't underestimate the viewing audience Miramax!

 Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it ""digital transfer"" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.
 
 I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.

Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First ""screenwriter"":"" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names"" Second ""screenwriter"" ""Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas"".

 But, that is a message that does not play well as this 90 minute movie.  I mean with quotes like this ""Maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature.""  just went too far for me.
 
 This movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay.  The musical score was fine enough as was the melody.
 
 If you want a better dog movie, go get something like Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows.  Both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion.

70,"I have Jennifer's Crunch Salsa Dancing DVD, and it was my first dance exercise DVD.  I loved it so much I've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor.  I find the moves too difficult and frustrating.  By the time you are close to having one step down, she's moving onto the next one, and it doesn't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that I enjoy in her Crunch video.  In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.  The end result was putting the two combinations together, so basically repeating four moves over and over, doing about six dance routines all together, which was good enough for me.  When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.  She looks great in this video, but I agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all.  Basically I ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles.

71,"It's a beautiful classic made during our time.  If you love romance, this is a beatiful remake of a classic. Love the children's and Annette's rendition of the Beatles ""I Will"".  Dissapointed that the song is not on the original soundtrack. I bought the VHS version in 96 and lent it to my friends.  They all loved it.  They kept wanting to borrow and replay it - for the song; as well as for the beautiful everything that best describes the the movie.  The VHS is now kaput and I definitely have this in my list of the next one to add to my collection of DVDs. Hope you will enjoy it too

72,"I saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot.  I recently purchased the DVD thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids (9, 8, and 6) to watch.  Also, it was rated ""PG"" so I thought it would be pretty safe.  I was wrong.  While the plot is innocent enough, the language was atrocious.  I couldn't believe this thing was rated PG and not at least PG-13.  Be advised that if you don't want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie, then this is not for you

73,"Sabu appears to be having a very good time as Mowgli, the child adopted by wolves who lives among the wild beasts as one of them; he swings from tree to tree like a nursery Tarzan.  In the dark-green jungles of this lush, handsome Alexander Korda production (directed by Zoltan Korda) Mowgli has more to do with humans than in the original Kipling novel.  Patricia O'Rourke is around for a suggestion of precocious romance; also Joseph Calleia is there for posterity...the screenplay by Laurence Stallings perhaps wandered a bit from Kipling, the segments concerning the python, the treasure and the ruined city are still thrilling in their way.  Children will probably still love the movie, and adults will have a better time than they expected... Look for a very young, very American Rosemary DeCamp

74,"If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad.

75,"From a lifelong lover of L&H films, zero stars, unless negative numbers are an option. These films are lousy through and through, and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them. They are painful to watch and about as humorous as Henry Daniell playing Doctor Moriarty. In deference to the two funniest men who ever lived, these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon Stan and Ollie after Roach sold their contracts.
 
 If you really like Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc L&H set from Amazon.uk. It contains all their shorts (sound and silent) and some of the early movies. It also contains  the foreign language versions, in which L&H and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in Spanish, French, etc. Further, it includes different versions of certain titles.
 
 For ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""Fra Diavolo,"" get the separate 2-disc set in NTSC. You'll have to purchase a region-free, PAL converting DVD player, but they are widely available in the United States and will play anything. (Don't buy a cheap one--the good ones are hardly expensive.

77,"We all see different films, even when we see the same film. ""City of God"" is especially like that, with it's linked stories that give multiple perspectives--not unlike the linked stories used in postmodern novels. ""City of God"" gives us a story of crime, poverty, drugs, sex, homelessness, corruption, community (in its own way), even odd bits of humor--and a way out.
 
 A Special Feature on this DVD is the documentary ""News from a Personal War"" which uses the same technique of multiple perspecitves in a brilliant effort to give a rounded view to a complex story of the drug war in Rio.
 
 The movie I see would be titled ""Portrait of an Artist as a Young Brazilian"" played by Alexandre Rodrigues as Rocket who narrates ""City of God."" The DVD jacket says it so well: "". . . a frail and scared young boy will grow up to discover that he can view the harsh realities of his surroundings with a different eye: the eye of an artist."" I love the moment when his photos are discovered by the newpaper through a mistake and how that leads to Rocket's career as a journalistic photographer--and his first hot shower, followed by his first sexual experience. This last part of the film is thrilling as Rocket moves into a new world and then rockets between them.
 
 Remember the lyrics that had a bouncing ball on top telling you what word to sing next? Just follow the bouncing ball here--the words and story line of the young narrator as his heart's wish comes true and he demonstrates considerable courage.

78,"Well it looks like my question regarding why these two ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"" DVD's are being released in September has been answered! Anywhey being honest, I do own one DVD of this series and that is called ""Starring Chip N Dale"" that is because there has never been a Chip and Dale collection on DVD before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons

79,"If you sre looking for the Anime style Little mermaid, The one with the sad ending, please note that this is not it! Now I havent seen this film but I'm sure it's fine lust not the one most people are looking for. The origanal in DVD format has a realy stupid cover but some nice person gave a few captures so I am sure that it's the one you're looking for. The cover is mainly blue with a blond haired mermaide who looks nouthing like Merina playing with some fish. The titel on the top of the page reads 'The Little Mermaid (UAV Corporation) (2000)' and if you look at the extra pics someone put up and reed the revews you'll not make the mistake of buying the wrong film. Hope this helps good luch

80,"This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog ""reviewers"" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. ""John Carpenter Presents""--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile

81,"I usually like romantic comedies, but this one was for the birds. Maybe the robin, our state bird here in Wisconsin. Then again, maybe not, since this movie seemed to get ALL the Wisconsin stuff wrong.
 
 People outside on Thanksgiving in just long sleeves? Not where I live. I mean, they could have chosen from about ten other midwestern states if all they wanted was that 'naive farm girl meets big-city boy' feel (which is lame and predictable, by the way). 
 
 I like Julia Stiles, and the young man was okay, but getting the local stuff wrong was a turnoff, and it really kind of took me out of the movie. 
 
 Tsk tsk.

82,"We LOVE this whole series of DVD's.  Our 13 month-old son never watches TV at home, but on long car trips, these are life savers!  The music is beautiful and soothing and the images are great.  He loves the ""real"" pictures of children, animals, and nature scenes.  We received the ""God of Wonders"" as a gift, and have since purchased the other two.  These are a great alternative to the Einstein videos if you want Christian music along with the videos

83,"I loved Yoga Shakti very much. There were 2 DVDs and a booklet inside the case and the first DVD contained all 4 yoga workouts like Basic Flow, Solar Flow 1, Solar Flow 2 and Lunar Flow. Shiva Rea performs all of these vinyasa flow practices alone on the gorgeous beaches of Maldives'Island and Kerala, India.The extra archival footage included of Indian festivals and practices in temples is also a nice surprise.This DVD is definitely worth every penny.

84,"Wow! Now people without cable can see some episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants! This DVD contains some popular episodes, such as ""Texas"" with the song ""I Want To Wake Up In Texas"", and the episode, ""F.U.N."" with the FUN song. The DVD also has the episode, ""The Graveyard Shift"" which would have been good for the next DVD, ""Halloween.

85,"I will not be buying this version. I have no desire to have a cherished Christmas classic with it's cover despoiled by an obnoxious picture of an obnoxious ""musician"".
 
 I will keep searching pre-owned DVD outlets for the previous DVD release of this, the one which hasn't been defaced by an ill-concieved marketing gimmick.
 
 What were they thinking? The people who don't care would have bought this either way, but they've lost those of us who do care. Seems to me like a counter-productive strategy. The people at Sony who made this decision should be fired

87,"John Goodman is king. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Dirty, raunchy, and completely unsuitable for teenage viewing, this movie makes it fun to remember what it was like when comedies actually contained full frontal female nudity! The locker room speech by John Goodman is one of the funniest things I have ever heard. BUY THIS MOVIE NOW! P.S. ""What is hairpie?"" or ""Step Aside Mama, I Wanna See Some of That Muff"".

88,"THE CORPSE BRIDE didn't quite captivate me like THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CRISTMAS did, but even so it was an imaginative and entertaining claymation film with great animation and interesting character designs. The movie's dark use of colors creates the feeling of a black and white film. The story sparkles with witty puns, for instance, we hear the bride say: ''That just takes my breath away...or it WOULD if I had any breath!'' This is a cleverly written, beautifully animated film that should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of eight.

89,"My son, husband, and I really do not like this DVD because (unlike other Baby Einstein DVDs) this DVD is too focused on cheap looking computer animation. There are very few puppet scenes, and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth. The music is pretty bad, too. I prefer the music of Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven. This sounded synthetic and computer-generated, not ""real."" I found this DVD to be boring and couldn't keep my attention or that of my son. My son (15 months) can't watch this entire DVD. He gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions  (which take up most of the DVD and are pretty fast in pace).  I was underwhelmed and wish I hadn't purchased this DVD. It is not like previous BE DVDs.  I suggest Baby McDonald, Baby Da Vinci, or Baby Mozart to those who wish to purchase a BE DVD.

90,"Most off the scientific facts are wrong. The earth's center is as big as Mars!!!!!! Come on!!!!!! Maybe as big as Moon. Under the Earth's ground is liquid magma. Its liquid because off the pressure, and its not possible to under it. The Producers obviously forget about food supplies, and oxygen. The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing

91,"This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.  
 
 The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.  
 
 The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers

92,"I laughed like a loon when I watched these shows as a kid.  My sides hurt and tears came to my eyes. For years, I told people that that this was the best, most creative, funniest show ever aired. I tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but I never did. Suddenly, I found this collection on Amazon and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch.  I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed.  Nary a laugh or even a snicker on the DVD. Truly disappoined after decades of waiting. Sigh!

THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS

97,"The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews.  I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD.  They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW.  I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info.  Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection.  I just wish they added more matches and interviews.  TNA better watch themselves.

98,"Why do I dislike Emma Thompson so much as an actress? Aha, I know why -- she can't act. She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal
