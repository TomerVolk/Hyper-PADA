0,"Most of the people looking at this book most likely already have an interest in women's studies, feminism, and the like.  If that's you, you're going to be disappointed.  You could already guess the author's point and what she's going to say, and she offers it all up without any interesting insights.  If you're just interested in stripping, you'll also be disappointed, because there's nothing particularly compelling about her story or the ""back stage"" scenes she offers.  If you're familiar with Eaves's reporting, from Slate magazine and such, you'll already be familiar with her style -- superficial analysis and lack of compelling argument or detail.  Skip this book -- there are better feminist analyses of stripping out there, and there are much more interesting stripper ""tell-all"" autobiographies as well.

3,"The wide variety of articles on leadership covers well items from the basic topics such as the difference between managers and leaders to how someone can be both (and the tensions that can cause!). Two of the best articles were on how leaders really spend their time during the day and how leaders foster an environment in which other people can also be identified and brought forward as leaders.
 
 I would've rated this five stars, but there are a couple of articles (on 'defining moments' and CEOs) that weren't a complete waste of time but seemed too far divorced from the typical leader within a company that I was surprised the HBR didn't find something more likely to be widely applicable to fill the space

12,"First off, I'm not a fan of the writing style. It covers so much information and time with little dialogue, or characters for that matter. But that's just the style. The way the story was presented was what I had a problem with.
 
 It seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like, and he didn't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book, so he just presented it as fiction, but didn't quite know how to do that. 
 
 Characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth. Then, they drop off. All of a sudden, near the end, they come back, and now they're like generals or something, or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of Armaggedon. WHAT?! 
 
 This book is a grid, a blueprint for a certain way it COULD happen. It is not a story about people, or a story with a plot. It is just a list of events that read on until Jesus comes. 
 
 The only reason I gave it two stars was because it didn't follow the whole rapture-theory at all(that word isn't in the Bible, and even implications of one doesn't say WHEN during the tribulation it would be). In this story, the Christians are here for the whole thing, and everything isn't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the Left Behind series. It follows the premise that throughout the last century or so, we've already experienced the Seal Judgements, and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face.
 
 IF you want a different take and aren't expecting much of anything else, read this, but not if you want a real story with passion or voice.

14,"Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.
 
 I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel. 
 
 What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative. Hardly any good. 
 
 Truth is I found it rather juvenile. In my my mind I found myself editing out the excess wordage. Perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story. There really isn't much here.  Indeed It isn't a good story. No challenge to the reader at all. Blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of.  
 
 It has all the defects of the first book compounded. 
 
 Toss it.

16,"If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.
 
 What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, ""bite the bullet,"" ""swallow the medicine,"" and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves

17,"Unlike so many tutorial or reference books on the subject of Illustrator, this book only skims the surface of the key functions of Illustrator.
 
 Things to be aware of:
 There are no companion CD tutorials - you're on your own. 
 This book does not give you detailed information on how to do anything.
 A few step-by-step examples are given on some certain methods, but mostly not.
 The few examples of ""How to"" are very high level and do not go into any detail.
 This book will not serve as a good reference book - information is to high level and does not include details.
 You will have to create your own graphics just to follow along the lessons so you can understand the concept.
 
 On the plus side:
 The book now has color illustrations.
 The tips on the bottom of each ""How To"" lesson are very useful.
 If you have a general knowledge of Illustrator, this book can be used without the software or a PC as casual reading.
 
 The book is broken down in seven parts:
 Part 1 - Prepare Your Illustrator Project
 Part 2 - Draw Objects
 Part 3 - Add Type
 Part 4 - Work with Drawings
 Part 5 - Manage Fills
 Part 6 - Use Layers and Styles
 Part 7 - From Illustrator to Print and Web
 
 This book borders on being useless for people who are seriious about learning Illustrator.

18,"""Shadowfires"" was another wonderful book in the long line of great Koontz novels, and this one was no different.
 
 We have the story of a woman named Rachel, and her husband, Eric Leben. Eric was a doctor in genetics who was fighting with his wife until he is pushed in front of a bus, by her, and killed. Rachel felt that maybe freedom was at last hers, until hours later, Eric is missing from the morgue, and we learn the awful truth of his secret work.
 
  I felt that this book had action from the very first few pages, and did not stop until the very last word. I was thrilled with the roller coaster of a ride that Koontz took me on, and i could not put the book down once i started on the journey. Koontz makes great use of location, and our fears of within, to give us this great chiller of the experiments of man to be more than human. A definite gem in the Koontz collection, a must have for any collector, and a great place to start for anyone taking a look at his work for the first time. A Masterpiece. My only wish of this book: It should have been made into a movie. -C

The book may tell more about foxhunting than you might care to know, but Rita Mae Brown makes the human and animal characters so likable that you keep wanting to know what happens to them next.  I hope she will give us more books in this style, as well as keeping on in her collaboration with Sneaky Pie Brown in stories about Mrs. Murphy's doings

24,"I genuinely wanted to like this book.  However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust.  It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian.
 
 That said, there is value in reading it.  The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research.
 
 However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration.  The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis.
 
 Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read.  But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations

29,"I generally respect Hillman, but he has wildly misconstrued the nature of war.  His basic failure is an utter lack of examining the gendered nature of warfare.  In short: Men make war.  Yes, there plenty of instances where women engage in war, but those are far and away the exception and not the rule.  Both the leaders who build wars and the soldiers who fight them are almost exclusively male.  This is a consistent fact across all cultures around the globe and throughout history.  Broadly speaking, women simply do not make war.  This single and glaring oversight immediately destroy's Hillman's hypothesis that war is somehow a universal human archetype

 His critique of what he calls the ""social control"" theorists is that they fail to take into account the ability of the powerful to delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing, even when they are most assuredly not.

33,"What to say about this book...it shows you wooden boat construction at its very, very best.  Starting with raw lumber and simple hand tools, Larry Pardey takes us, step by laborious step, on the odyssey of building a truly world class cruising yacht, his 30' Taleisin.  Not only is every step of the hull construction detailed, but we also get ""real world"" time and cost estimates so there are no illusions as to how much time and money each step will take.  There are superb ""pro and con"" treatments of aspects that have a variety of solutions.  If there are multiple ways to tackle a job, he makes two columns and discusses the pros and cons of each in detail.  Usually you just get the author's opinions without any extra information.
 
 This book is famous also because of it's very important final appendix on epoxies in salt water craft, and how epoxy often is weakened to the point of failure by salt water, repeated stress, and heat - 3 things that a sailboat gets plenty of.  I am told by many epoxy fans that this chapter ""is now out of date"", but I don't remember any amazing new epoxies coming out that make Pardey's findings defunct.  George Buehler says it best - epoxy works best when it's backed up by a bolt.  ""Praise epoxy but pass the nails"".
 
 Also note the title ""The Hull"".  That's all you get.  When it comes to decks, houses, rigging, etc., you're on your own.  Hopefully Pardey will bring out volume 2 on the rest of the boat.  
 
 He's a masterful carpenter and his work is glorious and gleaming, fully among the best of yacht-quality work ever done.  This is something you need to seriously soak in.  This is THE BEST, and not necessarily realistic for the average home boat builder.  This book represents a set of skills that you probably don't have, and may find difficulty developing in your lifetime, unless you are really dedicated.  Also, there is the time factor.  It's one thing to look at a photo of fastening planking on the frame and say ""I understand that...I can do that!"" and it's quite another to realize how many HUNDREDS of hours are involved in just a few of the aspects of the hull construction.  Pardey could work on his yacht full time - he didn't need to do other work to pay the bills.  He was also in the prime of his health.  Most Americans only have this kind of time if they're retired, and that often means not as strong as we once were.  If we're young and strong it means we have to work for a living.  So, this particular boat might be best aimed at the youngish man who doesn't have to work very much for his living.  Either that or you'll spend about a decade of weekends on this boat.  
 
 If you want to get on the water a little quicker than that, consider George Buehler's ""Backyard Boat Building"", for salty and sea worthy crusising yachts that the average man or woman can build themselves in a year or two, and actually take to the Caribbean, or further.  I'm not saying don't aspire to Pardey's level, but remember that you live in the real world.  It's better to build a simple boat than to not build a fancy one.  It's better to go sailing than it is to spend your free weekends for 2 years screwing down teak decking.  But, that consideration aside, there is no better guide to traditional yacht construction than this

34,"A more appropriate title for this book would have been: ""Transformed Away From The Truth...The Liberalization of the Worldwide Church of God; The Remarkable Story Of A Church's Journey From the Religion OF Jesus to a Religion ABOUT Jesus"".
 
 Love him or hate him...the lectures, broadcasts, published books and magazine articles of Herbert W. Armstrong brought many thousands of people all over the world to the knowledge and acceptance of Jesus Christ as personal saviour...many of whom had never even considered attending a church before! 
 This was no pop culture 'plastic Jesus', but the Christ of the Bible...whose actual teachings would still be much in disfavor in today's supposedly 'enlightened' Evangelical world.
 Yet, the author of this book vainly tries to insist that the Worldwide Church of God under the direction of Armstrong was more hung up on the 'Law of Moses' and the 7th Day Sabbath, rather than the ""grace"" of Jesus...and thus relegated Him (Jesus) to background status behind God the Father, and Bible Prophecy.
  
 In 1976 the WCG published perhaps the best book written to date about the life, person and teachings of Jesus Christ, ""The Real Jesus"" by Garner Ted Armstrong who, at the time was a high ranking Minister in the denomination. 
 This, along with all the other Christocentric books and articles published by Armstrong over the decades since 1927, are all strangely ignored...as if Armstrong himself, never gave Christ as much as a passing thought! 
 Joseph Tkach Jr. goes on to largely bear 'false witness,' as it were, against the Church; its teachings; its mission; and its founder and late Pastor General H.W. Armstrong. He takes Armstrong to task over having the audacity to actually think that God would use him, to start a new era in the chronology of Church history....yet he himself mulls over the same thing, in his own role in the destruction of the denomination, which ironically he sees as a new beginning 'under grace'...whatever that means, since he's gone on to disfellowship entire congregations in various parts of the country...for continuing on in the traditional faith and worship practices, and for refusing to adopt his new 'tupperware party' style of pop-worship service.  
 About the most interesting thing in the book, were the charts tracing all the breakaway conferences, or 'splinter groups' as he calls them...however, the biggest irony is that the largest breakaway group, ""United Church of God"" now has more members than the WCG under the Tkach regime! 
 Another shortcoming of the book is the total lack of comment on, or concern for the victims of the Church's meltdown; the divided families; the fired long-time Ministers and other employees, and the total disruption of the Colleges. Perhaps the Church's new leaders need to write and sell books to make an income; since over 100,000 members picked up and left the organization since Tkach and Feazell took over the reins. Make no mistake about it...he (Tkach) has his fans, who view him as a 'liberator', while his detractors suspiciously view him as the possible end-time 'Man of Sin sitting in the seat of Moses', mentioned in Revelation!
 Christ did say ""Ye will know them by their fruits..."" Thus far the fruits of Tkach's leadership have resulted in a bitter harvest

35,"Out on the Rim starts out delightfully enough.  The year is 1986, the place Washington, D.C.  Sixty year old counterterrorism expert Booth Stallings is hired by persons unknown to deliver a $5 million bribe to a troublesome Filipino rebel leader.
 But Stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy.  He'd much rather get his hands permanently on the 5 million.  Knowing he'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law, he takes on as partners Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.  Two lifelong friends who know their way around both the Far East and other people's money.
 By the time he gets to Manila, Stallings finds that he has four partners, not two.  You see, a con man named Otherguy Overby and an ex-Secret Service agent named Georgia Blue have cleverly insinuated themselves into the mix.
 Out on the Rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue.  There's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up.  In fact, about two thirds of the way through, the complications start to get a bit out of hand.  And that is the book's main flaw.
 Written with wit and urbane humor, Out on the Rim is deliciously engaging.  But the number of twists and turns could have been 50% less without detracting at all from the fun.

36,"This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this. 
   The reason for this one star rating is this. 
 First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING! 
 Second, 496 pages filled with ""blah blah blah"" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent. 
   Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.
   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some. 
  Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton.

38,"THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE, in my opinion, is one of Minette Walters' best mysteries--at least one of her best I've read so far!  Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed.  Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception.  Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters.  Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth.  Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had.  This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations.  Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction.  Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery

39,"In the era of Avian Flu, the First Horseman is a chilling tale. The reappearance of the 1918 Spanish Flu near a North Korean bioweapons facility causes alarms to go off in Washington. The hunt for a potential vaccine leads to an unlikely venue: an Arctic mining town where victims of the flu were buried in permafrost in 1918. These victims, provided they never thawed, would still have virus material in their lungs. These material could be harvested for use in a vaccine.
 
 When American scientists finally reach the frozen town, they're startled to find an unsavory surprise awaits them. And things go downhill from there as an investigative journalist, the intelligence community, and other parties all race to get the vaccine before a biological attack is launched.
 
 Yes, you've got predictable plot twists and the conventional, whoa-is-that-guy-psychotic criminal mastermind. And, true, you know how everything will turn out in the end. But in between, a fair amount of excellent research detail and some chilling analogs to today's world of H5N1-brand Avian Flu make Case's book both highly relevant and truly ominous

45,"Pros:  Development of setting, characters, and interweaving stories.
 
 Cons:  Some might find the degree of detail too heavy and slowing.
 
 I usually start by describing some of the plot, but the story-lines are only about a third of this book's considerable charm. So . . . 
 
 The Setting: This is an alternate history tale, as far as the setting goes. It takes place on Earth, and more preciously in (what is left of) England. But, this Earth had no Ice Age, it was struck by an object (popularly believed to have been a meteor) that caused the Sundering (the seas rose, the land was mostly submerged, cultures lost touch with one another, the climate changed drastically), and humans live side-by-side with mastodons, mammoths, glyptodonts, and other creatures that did not perish (because there was no Ice Age). The result is an isolated England, that retains much of its past, but has culturally evolved away from what it is (to us). 
 
 The Characters: I am not sure that I have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky, interesting, amusing, well-developed characters. These are very realistic people, living in a surreal time. Even their names are colorful, quirky, and interesting: Dr. Pinches, Mrs. Matchless, Mr. Threadneedle, Tim Christmas. The characters and the writing speak strongly of a Dickensian influence, but is definitely also just plain Jeffrey Barlough's. 
 
 The Plots: Yes, I did say ""Plots"" in the plural. There are three, distinct story-lines, that share some characters and the same setting and time period. 
 
 The woes of Ms. Jane Wastefield is what I would entitle one story-line, wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment. How can she be rid of the fiendish thing?! Who can help her? Everyone wants to, but no one seems to know how. Will she succumb? Would defeat be as terrible as she fears? And what about her pet monkey? 
 
 The wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about Mr. Threadneedle, his apprentice Tim Christmas, and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house. Can they make it work? Will everyone be shocked? Will anyone believe them, without seeing the finished product? Will Mr. Threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment, if he succeeds? 
 
 The secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters. When rich old Joseph Cargo died, he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew, but who is Jerry Squailes, and why does he get one-fourth of the money? No one knows, and young Frederick Cargo, spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly, honest attorney, Mr. Liffey, go on a mission to uncover the truth. Will they like the truth, when and if they find it? Will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of Jerry Squailes, the unknown heir? 
 
 My Take: This book is some of the best escapist reading I have ever found. The world described is so different (but not) and so replete with interesting characters, that it becomes a great place to retreat to. The writing is very detailed, with tremendous development of setting, characters, and the interweaving stories. It is truly a fascinating journey to take, and the ending(s) is not how Hollywood or fairy tales would do it, with a panoply of happily-ever-after. However, it is also not depressing. This tale is just plain well done.
 
 The Bottom Line
 This is a very memorable experience that takes you to a different place and tells you an interesting tale about amusing characters.

46,"Although the book may be poetic and lyrically written, the superfluity of figurative language and abstract narration makes it difficult to extract the true meaning behind its short stories and anecdotes.  The lack of definitive characters, names, and personalities make it difficult to tell exactly what is going on and completely renders character development obsolete.  The book, although it addresses very real tensions on several factors, fails to drive home the significance of tribulations and common place yet serious issues that the migrant workers deal with because of it's occult language and stream of conscious stylistic writing.  If you can read Spanish, the original is far more impactful than the translated version, but still leaves the reader in an unsatisfied state of confusion as to what actually happened.  For those of you who do not care for stories without a story, this book is not for you

47,"I love the Alice books even though sometimes they shock me with their content to be honest. I have read about 6 of these books and I go out of order because I can't always find the ones I'm looking for. I read ""Including Alice"" before this and thought it wasn't that great; this one was much better. There is comedy, irony, heart break and some happy moments too. Alice and her friends are very much like a lot of teens that I have come in contact with. 
 
 I was pretty sad about her break up with Patrick although I knew they were broken up already. I really think they are each other's first loves but I doubt they will end up together in the end. Most teen romances just don't work out.

48,"Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.  
 Hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.
 He seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  He has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  Hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  I hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the world

I was under the mistaken impression that the way a person contracted hep c was by IV drug abuse or a tainted blood transfusion.  This threw me for a loop since the only blood I had ever recieved was in 1950 and 1959 and I had never abused any drugs, I had no idea this virus existed back when I had recieved blood.  I was afraid to tell my family what I had and therefore had no support.  After reading this book not only did I have more information with which to approach my family but an idea of what to expect in my life from here on out.  It is seldom one finds an information type book that is written in a way that makes it an easy read but this one falls in that category.  Even those in the mid adolescent years would have no problem reading and understanding the information.

51,"In this particular edition of the Communist Manifesto, the reader is treated to an introduction by Leon Trotsky, one of the central leaders of the Russian Revolution as well as some correspondence from Marx and Engels.  But it is the Manifesto itself which bears repeated readings and discussion.
 How could such a short work have been the basis for revolutions around the world?  It is due I think to the fundamental points made: i.e. that workers of the world must unite---as they have more in common with each other than their own national rich and powerful.  In very brief but cogent explanations, Marx and Engels give a concise history of mankind and prove that all history in the ""history of class struggles"".  Be it feudal lords and serfs or autoworkers and General Motors, it is still the truth.  If you can't get this book from Amazon, try books by Pathfinder under the ""new and used"" button above

52,"Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is an anthropological study of Japanese culture during World War II.  It was her job to ""spell out what the Japanese were like."" (3)  One of the great aspects of this book is that Benedict's main arguments hold true even to this day.  Although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective, her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid.
 However, due to the time that it was written, 1944-6, Benedict was unable to study in Japan.  Instead, she had to rely on articles already written about Japan and interviews with Japanese immigrants.  In doing so, Benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the Japanese: Japanese society is hierarchically structured, but in such a way that allows class mobility; that everyone has a debt, or &#24681; (on), they must repay to the world; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation.  For example, Benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of Japanese society, so much so that they have ""what is called a `respect language.'"" (47)  This means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener.  Before the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor was at the top of the hierarchy, followed by the Shogun, daimyo, samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants and finally the outcasts.  Japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well.  As a result of this, the Japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order ""they could trust their world."" (70)  It was a system which ""guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules."" (73)  Although the Meiji Reform attempted, in part, to do away with these class distinctions, it was not terribly successful: Samurai became powerful bureaucrats, merchants still became more and more wealthy, farmers were farmers, and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation.  The same can be said even of today's Japan.  The elite families such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui are still very powerful.  Due to their integral role in Japan's economy, they are able to sway Diet members' opinions their way.
 Another unique aspect of Japanese hierarchy, Benedict tells us, is that it allows for class mobility.  Just because one is born a merchant's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner.  As merchants during the pre-Meiji era became wealthier, they were able to marry into samurai families.  In this way, the ""merchant's descendants become samurai"" and the samurai family marries into more money. (72)  Although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families, there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige.  By studying hard and getting into the best schools, one can be sure of a secure future.  If one graduates from Tokyo University, it would be very difficult to not find a good job.  In this manner, even a lowly farmer's second son can be an important man.
 One point that should be made clear about the Japanese hierarchy is that the American view of hierarchy is not quite correct.  Americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is.  However, the authority that a father exerts on his family or a Shogun over the nation is not dictatorial.  The opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made.  ""The master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty"" if he acts purely according to his own will. (55)
 Benedict's second main observance of the Japanese is their sense of &#24681;, or indebtedness, and the need to repay it.  The Japanese believe, she tells us, that when a child is born, he is immediately indebted to the Emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back.  The child is also indebted to his parents.  Only after becoming one ""does he know how indebted he is to his own parents."" (102)  Tied directly to this idea is virtue.  In Japan, repaying ones debts is a very important part of life.  One must always be careful to remember &#24681; to the Emperor and the parents.  Therefore, it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more.  This sense of repaying someone continues even now.  It is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a New Year's present as a way of paying him back for employment.  Also, when a guest visits a family he will often bring &#12362;&#37202; (sake) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family.  A peculiar side-effect of &#24681; is that people do not often help strangers in need.  To do so would be to give that person &#24681; they would likely not be able to repay.
 Benedict's final insight into the Japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation.  The most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the Occupation.  When the Emperor announced the unconditional surrender of Japan, the Japanese considered it a natural course of events and ""accepted all that such a fact implied."" (305)  There are numerous stories of the politeness showed to American troops upon arrival in Japan.  Even the fact that there were no resistance forces or sabotage attempts during the Occupation is a strong testament to this ability.  ""Japan's real strength,"" Benedict says, ""lies in her ability to say..., `That failed,'"" and take a completely different path. (304)  Benedict then says Japan ""could make herself indispensable in the commerce of the East,"" which could not be closer to the truth. (314)  Japan's economy boomed after the Reconstruction and made it the technological center of the world.  Of course, anyone could make such a prediction given the fact that Japan was no longer allowed to have an army.  All the money that had been poured into the military could now be directed elsewhere.
 Overall, I believe The Chrysanthemum and the Sword accomplishes Benedict's goal of describing the fundamentals of Japanese culture and is a great addition to the existing literature on Japan.  As I have previously stated, some of her examples are indeed old-fashioned (i.e. the stern mother-in-law and the tale of Hachiko) and may appear irrelevant to the study of modern Japan; however, what she is able to draw from these examples is still applicable.  We should consider that even though America today is much different than the America of the `40's, the same sorts of principles are held today - this can also be said of modern Japan

55,"With new findings from a scientist of the Los Alamos laboratory, the main thesis of this book-that the Turin Shroud is a medieval forgery-has been dealt a death blow. The new information clearly shows that the portion of the Shroud used for the 1988 C-14 test was, in fact, an additional weave to the Shroud threads made much later than the cloth itself, and that the winding sheet is much older than C-14 indicated.
 Even without this explosive new information, much of Nickell's thesis was outdated well before the year 2005. His ""recreations"" of the Shroud are amateurish and are not clear evidence of forgery. Most of his other information-""paint on the Shroud"", no provenance before the Middle Ages-has also been debunked many times over. And his star witness, Walter McCrone, had his own reputation tarnished beyond repair when it was proven that his analysis of the Vineland Map was discredited and debunked(ironic, since both Nickell and McCrone tried to destroy and besmirch those who didn't agree with them).
 
 In short, Nickell's book is now passe, and obsolete. It gets two stars for its entertainment value, but the main arguments and ideas of this book have been thoroughly refuted,once and for all.

Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.
 
 And that's only the start of the plot. 
 
 Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.

The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.

 It starts out great: it's wonderful to be with the boys again as they go fishing on a foggy morning in Strawberry Lake, and somethign BIG falls from the sky and lands somewhere in the water... To be back on Strawberry Lake again with these brainy, energetic boys is terrific, and right away there's a mystery to solve.  The boys enlist the aid of Henry Mulligan to find the object that fell in the lake, and how they do it-- using some trigonometry and a magnetometer-- is described with scientific accuracy, believeable, clever and entertaining.  It's such a relief to have a plot where problems are solved by something other than Harry Potter's wand.
 
 But after the boys tell the Air Force where they found the object, the plot seriously bogs down.  For all intents and purposes, the boys aren't really involved in the plot thereafter, except as observers and (maybe) engineers.  The boys just invent solutions to problems-- and they are clever solutions, described with scientific accuracy.  But the Air Force does all the ""action"", and the boys just watch them through a telescope as the adults try to retrieve the lost atomic bomb.  I understand that it's realistic that the Air Force would go after a lost atomic bomb themselves, and would not let any civilians anywhere near the site-- yes, realistic, but it makes for a boring story.  It's not fun anymore when the adults do all the work.
 
 The adults are an important part of the story, and the adult characters are all paper-thin cliches (the good-hearted Air Force colonel, the hard-bitten reporter, the fat news photographer), uninteresting.  Brinley was a brilliant plotter, able to write plausible real-world stories with clever twists-- but he had a major defect as a writer: he loved to write ""clever"" dialogue full of ripostes and ""witty"" put-downs, which in fact were never clever or funny.  The adults do a LOT of talking in this book-- whole chapters consist of their dialogue-- and when the idiot mayor of Mammoth Falls is engaging in ""clever"" repartee with the barber or some other adult, the witticisms are so unfunny, it just makes me wince

70,"Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on.  This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America.  There isn't really a plot.  The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal.  It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author.

I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and ""beauty diversity"", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls.

In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence

75,"J. M. Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is""Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School"".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as""Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies"" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 ""Failure of the 'New Economics'"".

Even harder to figure out is how the American Library Association could award its Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized ""servant girl"" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad

78,"I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices. 
 In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book.
 Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing

79,"Notwithstanding the L. A. Times describing this book as easy-to-use and informative, I found it close to useless. The basic problem is that it does not give information for any individual drugs - it gives info only for drug classes. As an example, I tried to get information on using Cipro for travelers' diarrhea. I had to look up Cipro in the index, where I was referred to the fluoroquinolones section, which lists Cipro along with 12 other wide-spectrum antibotics. There is no Cipro-specific information regarding usage, dosage, or anything else. (Nor was there any mention of travelers' diarrhea.) Since the information covers 13 distinct, although related, drugs, the information is necessarily very generalized. By way of contrast, The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs 2006, which I purchased at the same time, does provide descriptions for individual drugs, and it lists travelers' diarrhea as one of the off-label uses for Cipro. The PDR Family Guide also lists individual drugs

80,"I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.  
 
 I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably

82,"We have enjoyed another of Eric Carle's books--Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See--since my son was a few weeks old.  So, when my son was about 7 months old, I bought From Head to Toe.  It was a wonderful purchase!  After a few reads, my son was imitating the animals just like his mama--waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat.  It was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books I read to him.

83,"Obviously, the population of the world has been growing dramatically for the past few centuries.  How high can it go?  At how high a level can it be maintained?   What restrictions are placed by the available resources, such as food and water?  
 
 This book asks many of the right questions.  And it admits that we don't have all the answers.  But it does give some clues about where we may be headed.
 
 Cohen shows that basically, if we want to support people indefinitely on 3500 kilocalories per day from wheat energy, with 9000 cubic kilometers of annual fresh water supply, well, we can support only 5 billion people.  We're already beyond that.  Right now, we're using up resources at an incredible rate.  And while the Earth could support 10 billion people in theory, it is hard to see how it could do that for long in practice.
 
 The author thinks that we'll never get to the absolute maximum that the Earth can support.  Most people would all be right on the edge of starvation, and we'd simply be unable and unwilling to stay in that state indefinitely.  But I did realize after reading this book that we could stay at about 5 billion people for a very long time if we put our minds to it.  Standards of living would not be high, but they would be tolerable for the majority, and the ones who found such a life acceptable would keep having children who found it acceptable.
 
 Those of us who have political views ought to wonder if time is on our side or not.  And that is why I think it makes sense to try to imagine what options are available for our mutual future.  That's why I think this book is worth reading

84,"I had heard of this book through someone else and wanted to read it because of the self-help quiz at the book's website.  However, when I got the chance to read it, I finished it almost in one sitting.  Like one of the other reviewers said, it reminds you of the basics and how the act of being nice to someone no matter what their station is in life can ultimately change your life.  What I like is that the book doesn't teach  you to fake being nice; it challenges you to actually be genuinely nice to others, often with no thought of gaining something in return. A simple principle but as its many examples illustrate, a powerful one that can impact your life in ways you'd never expect.

86,"'Space Station 7th Grade' is a great, funny, and enertaining book. My son is in the seventh grade and reading this book was like reading a real life story of a kid new to middle school. 
 
 I really enjoyed the part of the book when Jason first had to take a shower after PE. Students having to run around in a huge shower room together naked as jay birds is many elementary kids 'worst nightmare'. My son's PE teacher has really good pointers, www bganssle com tsshowers html, for parents and kids who share this worry. Kids who feel awkward about their first showers at school, trust me and be like Jason in the book and give it a try. Soon any discomfort will pass.

87,"Not too many children's authors could get away with a story in which a bad little boy is eaten up by a lion, but Sendak handles this potentially unsettling story line with a master's touch. 
 
 Children will love the repetition of ""I don't care,"" which seems to be Pierre's response to everything, and the varied rhyme scheme keeps the text from becoming a monotonous set of couplets. 
 
 After his exasperated parents leave him home alone (the picture of them walking away from Pierre's perspective might actually be more of a threat to the listener than being eaten), a lion shows up at his house. The foolhardy Pierre is not impressed in the slightest, and won't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten. After Pierre's parents return home, they figure out what happened, assault the lion, and take him to the hospital, where a chastened Pierre is extracted uninjured. 
 
 Sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there. Like Shel Silverstein and Roald Dahl, there is a hint of wickedness to his work, but it's all in good fun. 
 
 This is a classic, pure and simple; a complete Sendak collection is a good idea for any child!

88,"I'd seen the movie ""Valley of the Dolls,"" whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book, but only recently did I read Jacqueline Susann's magnum opus.  What a pleasant surprise! This engaging novel, despite its length, is a fast read.  It is better -- far better -- than the film. (The movie, however, is a ""must see"" for its over-the-top acting, 60's fashions and ""so bad it's good"" storyline.)  
 
 Although initially billed (to great effect) as a steamy romance novel, the book is much more substantive.  Each of the characters is well-developed, and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing.  Before it was fashionable, Susann used the character of Anne Welles to explore one woman's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career.  Susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon.  Neely O'Hara is initially a sympathetic character, but has enough of the ""bitter greens"" (envy, jealousy and bile) which, when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills, leads to  her rise and fall.  And Jennifer North knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations.  These characters are real, and one need not be in show business to know them.
 
 Although written in 1966 (with a story that begins in 1945), the plotline is not dated.  Neither is the message: Susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness.  There is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers.

89,"I would give this book less than one star if that were possible. After reading the reviews, I eagerly ordered ""Trust"" and anticipated reading it.   Well....I read it and what a waste of time.  Stilted, unnatural dialogue and narration, a spoon-fed simplistic plot, robotic and one-dimensional characters, and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst I have read in many years.  The sentences ""He stared into her eyes"" and ""He placed his hand on her shoulder"" appeared four times in the space of six pages; then for good measure, the author throws them in several more times later in the book.  There is no context given; what do they imply--a threat, a romantic interest?  The writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up  and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader couldn't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next.  In my case, perhaps that was true because  the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting.  I forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when I began.  Did the author self publish this book?  Please, sir, go to writing school and get an editor

90,"If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must ""... forgive God"" and that we must love God ""... even if He isnt perfect"". Kusher even has the will to say that ""...God would not be God..."" without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said ""...let US make man in OUR image"" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.
 
   Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that ""... God so loved the world"" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. "" for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..."" The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question ""WHY""

91,"I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.
 
 The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.
 
 Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .
 
 The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.
 
 This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.
 
 Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man. 
 
 In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.

Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud

 The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?

94,"In the post-communist world, the Cold War espionage genre may seem a little dated. We have other concerns and fears on our minds now. But for reasons I'll get to below, this novel series is a stand-out from that era, and still well worth reading.
 
 This book was actually written after the fall of communism, but the plot takes place a few years before it. In this book Samson returns to work for London Central and deals with a disastrous assignment in East Germany; an internal struggle to keep positions in a down-sizing agency; etc.
 The book plot is interesting enough, but running alongside it are several series-length plots that continue to engross the reader: can Bernard and his wife Fiona rebuild their marriage after her apparent defection and return? In fact, can Fiona even recover from her ordeal? What about Gloria?
 
 I just recently re-read the entire Bernard Samson series (of which this is the seventh out of nine novels). It is one of the best novel series I have ever read, and certainly one of the best espionage genre series ever. There are so many things to like about this series - the in-depth characterizations; the pithy observational asides about people and cultures; the references to multiple languages and their subtleties; the gritty European settings; the hidden plot developments and character motivations that the narrator either can't or won't see; etc.
 
 The author claims that each of these books can be read on their own, and perhaps they could be. But you can get a lot more enjoyment out of it if you start at the beginning with _Berlin Game_ (or even better yet - start with the WWII prequel: _Winter_).

96,"I know I'll get criticized for not ""getting"" this book.  I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this.  Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.
 
 Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts.  The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today.  Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone.

98,"This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic.

99,"Even the avid ""trekie"" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying ""Beam me up, Scotty.""  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide ""Rapture.""  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer. 
 
 The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions. 
 
 In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.  
 
 Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's ""new evangelism"" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the ""Tribulation Force"" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.
 
 They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.
 
 The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.
 
 I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the ""left behind"" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.
