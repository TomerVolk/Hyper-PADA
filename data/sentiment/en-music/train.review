1,"After scoring their first number one album, The Heat Is On, The Isley Brothers' followed that classic up less than a year later with 1976's amazing Harvest For The World.  The band has always had something to say and never have they said more than on the amazing title track.  A call for understanding and unity, the song has more relevance today than it did twenty-five years ago.  The album is worth it for that song alone, but the rest of the album stands up as well with &quot;People Of Today&quot;, &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; and &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; standing out.  The album peaked at number nine on the charts

3,"Being a fan of mostly punk rock music... I decided to give this a try. This record is highly entertaining, very fun and very original. I didnt even know that &quot;gypsy-punk&quot; existed untill I heard this. The musicianship is quite good as well. Chanty, boot stompin' songs with accordians and fiddles. I like it. I reccomend this if you like the more folky brands of punk rock (ie Swingin' Utters, Tossers, etc.) So, if you're willing to give something different a try, go ahead and pick this up

6,"I bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on II. Instead, I found the music to be busy and impersonal, and I thought the lyrics (once again in comparison to those on II) sucked. Its often said that Up on the Sun demonstrates the Meat Puppets coming into their own 'sound', and that its a vast improvement over II. I fail to see how their work on II was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work

7,"_blue_ is simply a masterpiece of pop-rock music! it has tons of massive hooks, sweet grooves, incredible melodies, awesome vocals courtesy of mr. jenkins, and dashes of experimentalism! the melodies soar overhead with his sweet falsetto voice, the drums rip and roar through some funky bass grooves, and the guitars strum delicately or spit out a distorted lullaby of happiness. as much as i enjoy third eye blind's eponymous debut album (which is one of my favorite pop albums ever), i think _blue_ is even better. it is impossible to deny the songsmanship on display here. everyone should listen to this album

8,"Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, ""out of my body, out of my skin,"" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of ""One More Hour,"" the fury of ""Words and Guitar,"" the sexiness of ""Dance Song '97.""  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart

13,"I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get ""Out Louder"", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought ""End of the World"" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.  
 
 THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's (""Out Louder"" and Scofield's ""A-Go-Go"" which they ""back"" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.  
 
 I must say I like ""Out Louder"" and even ""A-Go-Go"" better than ""End of the World"", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians

Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north.

17,"&quot;Two of a Mind&quot; is a studio-only project from the summer of 1962. Desmond had done a record led by Gerry several years prior, and it was Mulligan's turn to play with Paul on a project he would control. Because of heavy workloads, the two principals collaborated in three separate sessions during June, July and August in New York. Also due to scheduling difficulties, the rhythm section changed at each session. On the six tunes which made the original LP, there are three different bassists and two different drummers. Also on the six LP selections, Desmond did a little studio trickery: some of the improvised solos were put together from different sessions, and on one tune he overdubbed a third saxophone for one verse. If you didn't know this, however, you'd never guess it. The counterpoint improvs of Gerry on baritone and Paul on alto are consistently interesting. Overall the disc is more uptempo than Desmond's other work as a leader. The product lacks that special magic which can often be found on a good recording by a quartet which plays live together and often, but it is a subtle loss. This reissue adds five bonus tracks, including two with guitarist Jim Hall which did not make Desmond's final list for LP inclusion, but which are quite nice. The two leads are highly skilled, and they seemed to like each other a lot and to bring out good things for one another. Not Desmond's best work by a long shot, nor Mulligan's, but worth owning if you are partial to either man. I'm glad BMG is doing these Bluebird First Edition releases from the RCA vaults. The booklets are usually quite good. They come in cardboard cases instead of jewel cases, and I'm not sure if I like that or not yet. Maybe they  could knock a dollar or two off the price and be an even better value, but if, like me, you enjoy the classic jazz of the 1946-'66 generation, you should buy some of these reissues to encourage the company to keep them coming

18,"These days, it seems like you hve to try to be a reality star inorder to make it big. For a celebutant like Paris Hilton, she doesn't really deliver as a solid an soulful singer. That is very unfortunately  big shame. Her second single, Nothing In This World, isn't a very good song from a wannabe pop star. The song like Stars Are Blind, is just as bad. I am not very convinced at all. She sounds like she is trying to had to really deliver like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson. To actually be honest with you, I'd rather listen to Michael Jackson instead of this. Paris is not aything in this world, and this song is just the shameful same.

When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music.  I got it, it got me--we connected.

23,"I wish amazon allowed giving ""zero"" stars to an album.
 
 I bought my first John & Yoko album in 1969 (""Life with the Lions."") I got ""ripped off,"" although I should have know better..  I was smart enough not to buy ""Two Virgins"" because of the bad reviews.  I bought ""Life with the Lions"" without reading any reviews, but I was young, naive, and a big Lennon fan.  Oh well!
 
 The John & Yoko albums released before the breakup of the Beatles were all pretty much the same.  The chief instigator of these albums seems to be Yoko.  Her background in the ""avant garde"" and ""conceptual art"" is apparent in these albums.  The basic premise is: take a ""concept"" and run with it.  Keep running with it for as long as possible.  Let's hear John & Yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour.  Let's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate.  After all, the big joke is that John Lennon's name is on this album... so even if the ""concepts"" are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will BUY this piece of vinyl because a Beatle has his name on the cover!!!
 
 ""The Wedding Album"" was the BIGGEST rip-off I ever experienced as a Beatles fan and purchaser of all things Beatle.  When this album came out in 1969 it was priced HIGHER than a regular album because it was a big box!  The graphics for this product HAD to cost more than the recording costs.  The recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish.  Feel like hearing John & Yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour?  Feel like hearing ""home audio"" of every inane bit of their ""bed-in for peace?""  I sometimes think the most ""conceptual"" thing John & Yoko could've done with this project would have been giving the customer an EMPTY box!  It probably would've sounded better.  
 
 Buying the CD version of ""The Wedding Album"" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.  
 
 I don't recommend buying ANY of John & Yoko's ""conceptual"" albums.  Do yourself a favor and make one of your own!!

28,"Although not a document of a working band, this is clearly a record Dave Douglas wanted to make. Following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers, he has drawn together  the sympathetic talents of James Genus, Bill Carrothers and Billy Hart to  pay tribute to Joni Mitchell. Hers is music he obviously loves, the  reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire. The other  music uses Joni Mitchell's ear for a great tune as a springboard for Dave's  thoughtful, instantly appealing compositions. Beautifully recorded, this is  a one-off; don't miss it

29,"I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again

34,"In my opinion this is Snoop's second best album even today, behind you guessed it, Doggystyle.  That said it isn't even close to being as good as Doggystyle, but it is still a good album and after Da Game... and the slightly dissapointing Doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost.
 
 Da Game.... featured No Limit production and loads of appearances by No Limit rappers, and as a result was wack, both have been cut back here.  Snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for No Limit Top Dogg, including of course Dre, for the first time since Doggystyle.  There are also less No Limit rappers (any is too many though) featured, but surprisingly few appearances by his old West Coast homies.  Anyway best track is easily B*tch Please, which is a classic in any era, Snoop's verses are tight but Xzibit is really the star of this track, as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough.  My other top tracks are Buck Em, Just Dippin (both Dre produced unsuprisingly), Betta Days, Down 4 my Nig*az and Trust Me.  Snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on Snoopafella, where he basically re-tells Cinderella from his perspective.  Most of the other tracks are at least good, and the production for the most part is tight, though the album is not without filler (Gangsta Ride, In Love With A Thug).
 
 Overall this is an impressive album from Snoop, yes it is not Doggystyle, I don't think there ever will be another one.  People have the tendency to mark Snoop albums against Doggystyle, rather than on their own merit unfortunately though. I'd give it 4 stars, recommended

35,"If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal. 
 
 The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of ""Thunderstorms and Neon Signs"" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist. 
 
 Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it

On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison.  Although the songs on Ultra Dance 2 are last year songs, it is worth more than this one.

39,"The fact no one has reviewed this title before now kind of surprises me.

The particular version of &quot;Blue Monk&quot; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark.  It clocks in at 7:36 (the longest track on the record, most tunes are relatively short, preety much like the Blue Note period length wise) and features some awesome drum work by Blakey.  It is really great to hear Monk in a trio format, he really shines in this scenario.  I would definitely recommend this title to any Monk fan, or anyone wanting to start their Thelonious collection.  It really sets you up for Monk's &quot;original&quot; piano style

43,"Wow I just don't know where to start with this album.Well, about the album itself: I think this is best explained by the band, so here's what they think- ""How Strange, Innocence"" was our first attempt at an album. We recorded it in January 2000 in Austin: recording took two days, mixing one day, mastering one day. Altogether we pressed 300 CD-R copies of this album...We had been a band about seven months when we recorded these songs. A lot of feelings (excitement/confusion/glimpses of visions/waking dreams/inability to play instruments) went into this record, but we didn't quite know what to do with those feelings, none of us had even really been in a studio before, and it shows in the recording, the songs show it, too--it's a young record. There are no tricks in it. There's a lightness in a few of the songs that we probably won't reach again. It sounds strange to say that instrumental songs are about something, but to us these songs were/are about such things as a couple walking through the park on a winter day, a child playing on 70's shag carpet, the story of a boy hero leading a revolution against the tyranny of the coal mines. We've had a bit of a love/embarrassment relationship with the record. At certain points along the way several of us wanted to buy back all the copies and burn them. Listening now to this album, it almost seems like a different band composed of four different people. We finally feel okay in re-releasing it, probably because we've now made a couple of records that are recorded better and that are closer to our visions for them. Anyway, we truly appreciate anyone who is interested and listening. Thank you.""
 
 That was on the CD itself- hope you found that helpful. I like this CD for two reasons. 1.The wonderful way Explosions in the Sky can tell a story through their instruments. 2.This album has a distinct sound- one all its own. If you didn't like Explosions in the sky before, you will once you listen to this album.

45,"Game on, this is good stuff!  To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom,   But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring.  It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  
 
 The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all.  But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all.  But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well.
 
 This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect.  This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls.
 
 The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship.  Those are rare commodities in today's music industry.  Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom.

46,"As I said just above, this is a prime example of what I like to call Audio Art. From the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through. It is more electric then their debut release but it's a welcomed change. Not that the debut was bad. The songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there.
 
 I give it five stars because the music flows together so well, the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less

47,"Queensryche was never a band to sit still-- from their early metal roots on their first couple releases, the band began blending elements of progressive rock and other influences into their sound until ""Promised Land"".  In many ways a pinnacle acheivement in the band's history, it would have been extremely difficult to equal.  The album was well constructed, an acheivement of arranging and sound, and while it was unpopular with a number of the band's fans (who would have preferred a straight metal sound), it was certainly a unique statement.  Many bands would have been tempted to try for a sequel in sound and feel, others would have tried to get even more over the top, still even more would be likely to retreat backwards, to rejoin the metal sounds of their youth.  Queensryche did something quite different.
 
 ""Hear in the Now Frontier"" is a stripped done, bare record.  Gone are the swirling arrangements, the extra instruments, keyboards, synths, samples, layered vocal harmonies, etc.  Instead, straightforward riffing, blistering leads, and a looseness bleed forth, as though the band had been listening to what the other locals in Seattle were doing.  When I first heard the record, I hated it (even as a fan of the grunge movement that in many ways inspired it), but there was enough decent material to keep me coming back to it.
 
 These days I love it.  In truth, I think it represents guitarist Chris DeGarmo's waning interest in metal-- he exited the band shortly after and ended up playing guitar with Jerry Cantrell for a while, and his stamp is all over this-- 12 of the 13 cuts on the record were written or cowritten by him, and the best material (that which looks back as little as possible) was soley from his voice.  From opener ""Sign of the Times"", with its sludgy rhythm guitars and wobbly lead, its clear this is something different.  The best material on the record tends to be the less heavy work-- from the laid back ballad ""Some People Fly"" to swirling love song ""You"" to the brilliant and soporific ""Hero"".  DeGarmo even takes the mic from vocalist Geoff Tate on great love song ""All I Want"", and while some of the heavier and more abstract material also works well (""Saved"", the bizarre fan-favorite ""sp00L""), its really an album that excels in the midtempo pieces.
 
 The remaster is further augmented with b-side ""Chasing Blue Sky"" (a relatively uninteresting piece) and three recordings from the MTV unplugged show several years beforehand-- ""Silent Lucidity"" and ""I Will Remember"" get decent readings, but its really ""The Killing Words"" that is noteworthy-- its a fantastic and delicate performance of a great song.
 
 It doesn't sound like old Queensryche, but that's what I love about the band.  They'd reach higher heights, but there's an awful lot of great material on here that deserves listening.  Careful and patient listening will yield rewards

50,"OK so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of Glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album.  Instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of Glenn`s previous releases, Common Ground, Who`s been sleepin in my bed etc, which while good pale beside I Volunteer, That Girl, Some Kind of Blue which all sound like they could have been Eagles tunes.  Having said that it is a good album although I would recommend Soul Searchin, Strange Weather ahead of this one.  Further proof that the Eagles whole is better than its part

51,"I was around 16 or 17 when this record was released, and it was another Masterpiece by the Kings of Metal! This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom.
 This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has.
 
  The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill. 
 
 That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about.

52,"I picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like 2 years before this dropped and knew I had to have it. Im so pleased w/ this album (and all of supas music) that everytime I listen to it I like it a little more. One of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it's over. I just got deadline in the mail today and it's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds Ive listened to this year. You can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving. A true masterpeice and future classic

53,"Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player

54,"and I'm still listening to this gem. To be honest, I bought this IN SPITE of ""Kiss From a Rose"". I hated that Seal was getting SO MUCH air play becaus of that song... not that the song was bad or anything, but I fell in love with his first album, and I thought ""Kiss From a Rose"" paled in comparison to tracks like: ""Future Love Paradise"" and ""Violet"".
 
 All these years later, I can still enjoy listening to this CD. I am writing this review because I just popped it in while at work. There isn't a bad track on this thing

55,"After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A & M released ""Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994"", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings.
 
 Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does ""Fields Of Gold"" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives.
 
 Positives:
 -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes ""If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)"", ""Fortress Around Your Heart"", ""Be Still My Beating Heart"", ""Russians"", ""We'll Be Together"", ""All This Time"", ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"" and ""Fields Of Gold"". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here.
 -The sound is great.
 -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation.
 -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single ""When We Dance"".
 
 Negatives:
 -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: ""Love Is The Seventh Wave"" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat.
 -""Mad About You"" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd.
 -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of ""We'll Be Together"".
 -No liner notes.
 -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"", ""Brand New Day"" and the top twenty hit ""Desert Rose"". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on.
 
 Overall, ""Fields Of Gold"" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection
",5
56,"I agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the CD is simply supplemental to the film, is forgetable, nothing really stands out, there is a lack of melody.  Only one track (# 14) ""My Name is Lincoln"" -- stands apart, offering a theme, melody, choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that, for me, is really worth the price of the CD

58,"Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. .

65,"Most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard.  Others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously.  But Maysa Leak, vocalist of the underexposed Incognito, has a grace that oozes so effortlessly, that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she's able to do it.  Her solo debut isn't going to make anyone forget about Incognito, but it's a solid album that shows that she's able to stand on her own.  The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease.  Favorte tracks of mine are &quot;Black Heaven,&quot; &quot;Can We Change the World?,&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind.&quot;  Maybe, one day, the mainstream will catch up with Maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years

68,"When it comes to ""pop,"" people are use to hearing the crap played on the popular radio stations. Brittany Spears, and terribly horrid music like that. I want people to know the true meaning of ""pop"" music. Here it is in the dictionary:
 
 ""a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love""
 
 Now, before anyone bashes me, I don't agree with the ""bland"" and ""watered-down"" words, expecially in the case of Stephin Merrit, but it's true of the music played today. There's magic in this album. It's so full of life, and dare I say, the bliss of happiness. It's truly amazing how ""Wasps' Nests"" can completely change my perceptions. It puts me in a state of mind. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but this album happens to be the soundtrack to my life, as cheesy as that sounds. And no matter how cheesy the lyrics may be, You'll find yourself in love with them, almost as much as the luscious sound that is, ""The 6ths."" A masterpiece

83,"A brilliant work, and no this review isn't of much help really, but I'd like to forward a theory about the guitar solo in the prog rocker Roots of Coincidence: PM had been listening to Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson in the mid 90's as Scott moved away from compositional jazz-fusion toward fearless, bluesy, attitude-driven free-form guitar, decided Scott was having way too much fun at it - and with songs like ""Canine"" on TT's Face First who could argue? - thusly deciding to stake his claim on this invigorating new ground. It's good, interesting, but fleeting and disjointed, and Scott does it better. Still, what PMG here, on Imaginary Day as elsewhere, are able to render as musical generalists, by selecting from the full pallette of sonic colors and using each to maximum effect, ah!

Just hit the pause button after track 6. Take a deep breath or go to the bathroom or fix a drink. Then hit the play button.
 
 But seriously, there are so many countless trinkets missing from a collection called, ""20th Century Masters: The Best of the Andrews Sisters, The Millennium Collection,"" wow, that's a bit long winded. But, with a title like that you ought to have Rhumboogie, Beer Barrel Polka, Well Alright, Straighten Up And Fly Right, Rumors Are Flying, etc. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice introduction but just too short. 
 
 Buyer beware!
 
 Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room.

91,"First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!
 
      Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.
 
      I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...
 
      I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word ""Nothing"" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.  
      You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think ""Whoa!  Who's THIS?!"" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song ""Out of Range"" would do in less than 16 seconds.
 
      Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called ""Wishful Thinking"") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: ""ZEIT"".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.
      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.
 
      I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves ""WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!""
 
      Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song ""Next Time I Fall In Love"" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than ""Paranoid"" by Black Sabbath.
      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.
 
      Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, ""Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!""  
      I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.

   I hate good charlotte, they sound EXACTLY like every other prep-rock band (fall out boy, my chemical romance, simple plan ect.) I could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the ""song"" names that this had nothing to do with life or death, and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs. After i listened to a couple of these so called ""songs"" i turned it off, and quickly threw it out of the window.
   
     My point being, with bands such as this, don't expect anything hidden within the title, or the music. It will just be a boring listen the entire way through. If you were looking for an album that DOES have meaning, and is fun to listen too. I suggest eating your own exrement

96,"There are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less.  Its made by people on computers who aren't necessarily musicians and don't play any real instruments, therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience.
 
 Well for those of you still trapped in that mindset I invite you to check out ""One"".  Not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music.
 
 I was not aware of Dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were I believe more world/ethno music in nature.  ""One"" is truly a blend of electronic, techno, world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass.  The vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking.
 
 Highlights are the opener ""Waiting For Spring"", ""Close To Us"" & my personal favorite ""A Way To Love"".  Also included and I believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of The Moody Blues ""Nights In White Satin"".
 
 This record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be

97,"Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (""The Game Is Sold..."") and when he dropped a decent album (""Paid The Cost...""). ""The Blue Carpet Treatment"" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.
 
 This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. ""Think About It"" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit ""Thats That..."" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit ""I Wanna Love You"" with Akon, another hit for this album. 
 
 As I said in my title, this is what ""Cali Iz Active"" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. ""Candy"" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. ""LAX"" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's ""Going Back To Cali"" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with ""Imagine"" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with ""Conversations"" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).
 
 Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. ""10 Lil' Crips"" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song ""Beatin' Up On Yo Pads"" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.
 
 If you heard that this album was his most consistant since ""Doggystyle"", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters ""Tha Blue Carpet Treatment"".

98,"This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring
 ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of
 raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have
 ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning,
 & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves.
 This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best.....................................

99,"The debate over the performance of J.S. Bach's cantatas boils down to the  following: the evidence suggests that Bach only had one singer per part for  performances of his cantatas. Thus, any historically accurate performance  of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach. At the same  time, however, there is additional evidence that Bach wanted more  performers. We are thus stuck with deciding whether Bach wrote for the  musical forces he had on hand (which seems logical enough) or whether he  composed for the performers he would like to have (which would seem silly,  if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions.  On the other hand, Bach does make &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;tutti&quot;  distinctions in the score... draw your own conclusions).  Rifken is a  strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach, which may seem a  little sparse at first. Yet, when one listens to the various cantatas on  these disks, one must confess that these sound, well, beautiful. This may  not be an approach which would work for all of Bach's works, but the  effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity.  Regardless of where you fall-- and if you fall-- in the strenuous debates  over historical performance, I would heartily recommend this disk. Not only  are the performances polished, but the works themselves are exquisite-- a  wonderful sampling of Bach's cantatas. (Personally I am addicted to the  duet, &quot;Wir eilen mit schwachen, doch emsigen Schritten&quot; from BWV  74 which I could gladly listen to over and over-- listen to it and you will  see why.

100,"Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that). 
 
 2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio

102,"I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio. 
 
 THE CD:
 This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: ""Missing"".
 
 THE CONCERT:
 The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.
 
 Awesome performances include:
 ""Thoughtless""
 ""Breathe No More""
 ""Farther Away""
 ""Bring Me to Life""
 ""Whisper""
 
 DVD FEATURES:
 This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for ""Going Under"", ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Everybody's Fool"", and ""My Immortal"". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of ""Bring Me to Life"" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track ""Missing"". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it

103,"2 1/2
 
 Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways

I love the sound of this band, with the easily recognizeable sound of the Northettes, arrangements Rhodes el-piano, solos with the Lowery organ (***** to Dave Stewart), the sleepy voice of Richard Sinclair and overall atmosphere. Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites...

My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :

112,"In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the ""Jamming With Edward"" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.) 
 
 Ry said the Stones ""stole"" his sound and riffs. He said ""Honky Tonk Woman"" was an example of this ""ripoff."" In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.
 
 Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called ""devil"" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered ""satanic.""
 
 Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money. 
 
 I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company.

114,"Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds
  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is
  
  I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.
  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring. 
  I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.  
   With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system.

115,"Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love ""Dysfunction"", I like ""Break the Cycle"", ""14 Shades..."" was tolerable, and I really enjoyed ""Chapter V"". However, even for a debut, ""Tormented"" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the ""f-word"" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks

It's crazy that after listening to them for so many years I still enjoy them so much, but their music just doesn't get old.

118,"Wow, I just received ""Reiter In"" and am in agreement with other reviewers.  Chris Whitley has always been a favorite of mine, ever since the stunning debut of ""Living With the Law"".  I saw Chris on tour supporting that album in Seattle, on a double bill with Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The auditorium was packed with young Seattle suburbanites to see Toad, then when Chris took stage, half the place emptied out.  The faithful, knowing remainders witnessed a typical Chris show; searing, passionate, but also flawed and overly amplified.  Chris chain-smoked the entire show, and said little to the audience, but when I left I knew I'd seen an artist with no peer.
 
 ""Reiter In"" is an amazing cd-probably for the first time, Chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians.  Although unpolished and recorded to analog, the band is cohesive, lending a jukejoint feel to Chris' guitar playing.  This music doesn't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it's got elements of Led Zeppelin/The Black Keys/""Achtung Baby"" U2, with some Depression era blues tossed in between.  Rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges, Chris gave us sweaty, soulful, life-affirming music, a most fitting end-note

120,"This album has it all. Utterly gorgeous. Bittersweet Symphony serves as a classic opener, complete with luscious strings. A perfect video clip to match too. Don't try walking down a busy city street while listening to the song. You'll start trying to imitate Ashcroft's negligent and arrogant swagger.
 
 While Sonnet is sweet, The Rolling People and Come On are epic, angry, arrogant songs that just make you wanna sing out loud and just go off. It's an adrenalin rush in your ears....
 
 Lyrcially, the songs are deep. Ashcroft is a fascinating lyricist, and his sentiments in Weeping Willow and The Rolling People are endlessly intriguing.
 
 70 minutes long, but it's a soaring sensation. Every song has merit, even Neon Wilderness that is pivotal to maintaing the perfect flow of the album.

121,"The songs on this album are outstanding, the writing is direct, the themes are the same ones Neil has always sung about, making relationships last over time, country living, the road.  But the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason I keep coming back.  Obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form, but the vocals are right where I want them, and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me (and believe me, I've listened to some agitating music - Teengenerate anyone?).  I guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium, this album isn't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars, but because everything fits, in a smooth and soulful way.  Never gimmick.  Always authentic.  Neil transcends the genre again

122,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.
 
 It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.
 
 The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.
 
 Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.
 
 Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...
 
 Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.
 
 Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.
 
 Track 5 - Ugh.
 
 Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...
 
 Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.
 
 Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?
 
 Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.
 
 Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.
 
 Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.
 
 Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.
 
 Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.
 
 Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...
 
 Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.
 
 Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.
 
 Flame away, kiddies.

123,"This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.
 
 Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular ""I Need All the Friends I Can Get"" and the truly sad ""Dory Previn,"" about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken,"" named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, ""Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?""
 
 All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart

124,"To even begin to describe the music on this CD is difficult...it's like trying to describe what God looks like. Not only is the music just incredible, but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet.

126,"Being a long time fan of MLWTTKK, I immediately pre-ordered this tribute/remix collection. Upon hearing the first few moments of this CD, it was blatantly clear that whoever remixed these Kult classics had little regard for the originals' lustre. The mixes are light, airy.... pure fluff. Don't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that TKK has delivered to its fans for many a year. The mixes butchered the originals to the point that it's not even novel, just cotton candy filler. How TKK allowed this malformed release is beyond me. The only purpose I see that this ""tribute"" could serve is to introduce TKK to a young lightweight, whose ears are not used to original industrial epics. Either that, or only for the hardcore TKK fan who just wants to have every release. The dust on my copy is already accumulating, and probably will for some time. If you're looking to dip your toes into My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, don't buy this CD. Stick with the new greatest hits release, or better yet, start with any release prior to ""Hit & Run Holiday""

131,"Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.
 
 'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that ""Heroes"" tops it in every regard.
 
 The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.
 
 The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on ""Heroes"", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:
 
 'Your lips cut a smile on your face'
 
 'There's slaughter in the air
 Protest on the wind
 Someone else inside me
 Someone could get skinned'
 
 'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
 They never die, they just go to sleep one day'
 
 And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the ""Heroes"" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released. 
 
 
 The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on ""Heroes"" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.
 
 Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.
 
 If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend ""Heroes"" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release. 
 
 It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist.

132,"First of all,Decca engineers insist on to differentiate ""their"" Scholl's voice from that more sweet,resounding previous Harmonia Mundi cd's like Bach Cantatas Solo,English Folksongs and so on where it was a pleasure to hear this singer.Even orchestra Bizantina could be better recorded;maybe Milano Auditorium hasn't fine acoustics.However,the same happens on ""Heroes"" and ""Banquett"".In this Senesino combo just here,Scholl's voice sounds rough and unpleasant,the top of his range excessive and satured.Second of all,in my opinion,opera isn't his confort zone for good.I believe that as a chorister boy,he grew up in that german musical territory singing sacred music by Buxtehude,Bach,where he did his best on recording.In this cd,I heard his worse;a rugged vocalization plentiful in ha-ha-ha,absolutely abusive that seems dreadful to me(""Al lampo dell'armi"" for instance),his vocal colours sounding like croacks sometimes,incongruous and dramatically unfruitful attempt to perform repertoire previously recorded by himself like it was a new,fresh one(""Dove sei"",""Aure,deh,..."").I'm sorry;I know Scholl fans are very zealous on their idol but I have heard much better Senesinos by Derek Lee Ragin,Daniels,Minter,Gall and so on.

133,"This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane.  Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world.  The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere?  And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her!  Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends??  No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'
 
 This is bad.  The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back.

136,"When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena. I pulled off and bought the CD. I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed &quot;Right Kind of Girl&quot;. There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. &quot;Your Big Night&quot; is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. &quot;Star Behind&quot; may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement.

Family Potrait speaks to a lot of people, including my brother, who overhead the song and keeps requesting me to replay track 7.   The whole album is a work of art so it's hard to choose, but if I had to choose, my favorites are Don't let me get me, Just Like a Pill, Family Potrait and Lonely Girl.  Pink's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice.  Once you listen to this album, you will want hear more.   So I will go ahead and let you know that her third album is Try This and her fourth, which is her best thus far is ""I'm Not Dead"".  So please give this album a chance.  Pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself.

144,"Darryl Worley's ""Have You Forgotten"" begs another, more relevant question -- ""Do You Read the Paper."" Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to ""our freedom,"" apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through.

151,"Ok, well I have to admit that I am as much a fan of the guitar sounds as I am Adam Duritz's voice. I would have rated this as a five star album, yet every once in a while (on maybe two or the songs total) Adam will get caught up in some moment singing and the dud gets kind of whiny. This guy is one of the best singers on the planet, though and this cd is still one of the best that the Counting Crows have ever produced.
 Okay, well, the guitar sounds are much more raw, very retro and vintage sounding, I wouldn't be suprised if every guitar, amp, and effects pedal are 30+ years old.
 My favorite songs are definitely Raining in Baltimore (amazing quiet version), Long December, Have You Seen me Lately?, Recovering the Satelites, and Round Here. If you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff. I've heard Adam's voice coompared with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. Although I would say that they are very unique I admit that for comparison they are simalar in style (Adam's better though). I hope you like the album. Enjoy

152,"It has been roughly one year since this album was released. As of today, I still find myself listening to it regularly, as this cd just has classic written all over it. The opening pair of songs are  nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener.
 
 Queens of the Stone Age may not have Nick Oliveri in it, but you can tell that this cd still kicks. All of the elements fall into play, creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind. You will find yourself rocking out with Medication and Someone's in the Wolf. You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album.
 
 This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future.
 
 Lullabies is utterly amazing. The high quality of the songs, as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic. It is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years. Do yourself a favor. Pick it up. NOW

 You can be a talented rapper.  Get an interesting voice with lots of expression, put in some good backings and you've got no problems.  But I-20 fails here on both counts.  Does anyone else think that he's got the most annoying voice?  That low drone is just a complete turn off and he doesn't even bother to vary his voice.  Maybe a good beat could have saved him, but there's no salvation here, either.
 
 In fact, the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention, only because we don't have to hear his voice - this makes Backstage & Hey Shawty bearable.  But, really, I-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album.  Feature on other people's songs, sure, then you can still be a star.  But at least then we won't have to listen to fifty mintues of you

158,"I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.
 
 The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds). 
 
 I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD

This recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings. It was really great to listen to this because I have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago. I think Florence Henderson is a natural for Nellie Forbush, I think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.So many people tend to just think of Ms.Henderson as that famous Mrs.Brady role. One shall be quite surprised. Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets. The rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores.

175,"Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the ""Goldberg Variations,"" but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental.  Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant ""Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner"" (BWV989).  Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations  - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig. 
 
 With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label.  And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series.  Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style.  She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music.  Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording.  
 
 Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines.  Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity.  Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance.  Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions. 
 
 In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights.  Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful.  But, in the famous 25th ""Black Pearl"" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march.  Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference.  Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit.  But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity.  But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal.  I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night.
 
 Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar ""sweetness"" of style as Hewitt.  As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality).  Many others have also given great performances.
 
 Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings.  ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations).  I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others.  But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations.  The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like.  All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion

176,"Unless one considers ""Planet Waves,"" Dylan's 1974 studio album with the Band playing backup, to be a Band album, ""Cahoots"" has no competition for the title of the worst Band album ever. Yes, the first two tracks are good (""Life is a Carnival"" - great rhythms, great horns, OK lyrics; and Dylan's ""Masterpiece"" -- does nothing for me, but I understand many people love it), but they are available on other compilations, so the reason to shell out for ""Cahoots"" has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere, and they are AWFUL. The songs, that is, not the performances. The boys sing and play as well as ever, but their efforts -- particularly some fine Danko vocals and Hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless, charmless and brainless. There is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11. Nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise: all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything (a RADIO COMMERCIAL?!). Save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians

178,"This is an excellent debut from Mindy. Her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good. &quot;Guys do it all the time&quot; is a fun slap in the face for all those &quot;macho&quot; types out there, the title song is my favourite though, but all are good, from the love songs to the fun songs. I hope she stays true to her roots though, and doesn't go the way of Leann Rimes and Faith Hill. One thing I have never understood though, is why nearly all country cds are limited to 10 tracks. This one for example is only 35 minutes long. Rock and pop cds quite often exceed 12 songs but country albums rarely even exceed 10. Anyway, thats just an observation, and doesn't take away from the worth of this album. Recommended

180,"From the live disc, Astronomy Domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc.  The bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder. The other three tracks are good, not great, performances of what are perhaps their first important post-Syd Barret compositions.  They are definitely not the band they used to be. The studio disc is a mess.  The first part of David Gilmour's suite is the best bit, some nice blues guitar.  Like disc one, disc two sounds muddy. My overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but hadn't yet figured out what to put on next. Live disc=3 stars; Studio disc=1 star; Net rating=2 stars

182,"Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it.

183,"HOLD THE FAITH: With his debut album release, VIRTUOUS WOMAN, Warrior King cemented a reputation as one of Jamaica's hottest conscious singers in recent years. Singles like NEVER GO WHERE PAGANS GO and VIRTUOUS WOMAN bust up the Jamaican charts, and established young Warrior King as a major talent with strong vocal range, delivering cultural as well as lovers' lyrics for some of the island's biggest producers. In light of such a powerful debut, HOLD THE FAITH turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. The album opens with an interesting introductory segment, and then the title track, which is decent but nothing to run out into the streets and shout about. From thereon out, HOLD THE FAITH rides a few crests - like the herbally inspired MEDITATION on the PASS THE KUTCHIE (FULL UP) rhythm, or the catchy sing-along, EDUCATION - but mostly hovers right around average, or at worst, sinks to sadly uninspired. Listening to forgettable roots-by-numbers efforts like FREEDOM and JUDGMENT DAY, there's little evidence that this is the work of the same singer whose compelling chanting style carried a modern classic like POWER TO CHANT to the top every reggae playlist. Even worse, there are a couple of performances - particularly the dreadful EVERYDAY - that sound like phone-ins; a real let-down, and not at all what you'd expect from an artist of Warrior King's caliber. Overall, I really believe that HOLD THE FAITH is just a misstep, and that if we can indeed hold the faith, Warrior King will be back to reward us with his very best before too long. Until then, this will just have to do

187,"This is the second volume of recordings of songs by writers signed to the Beatles Apple Music Publishing company. Though most of the artists contributing to the CD are pretty obscure with a very limited recorded material behind them, there are a few exceptions. 
 
 The Iveys, who later changed their name to Badfinger, are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group. Though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material, with Pete Ham's ""Black and White Rainbows"" as the strongest track. 
 
 George Alexander of Grapefruit wrote two songs for the CD; none of them recordings by Grapefruit, but both among the strongest recordings on the CD. 
 
 Songwriting team Gallagher and Lyle wrote four songs; three of them their own demos. Quite obvious that they were already at that time great songwriters. The Hollies sounding tracks ""Technicolour Dream"" and ""Ivy Unrehearsed"" are my favourites. 
 
 The obscure band ""The U No Who"" who later turned into ""Bachdenkel"", deliver some of the very best recordings to the CD. Quite amazing that Apple did not offer the band a contract. Their title-track ""An Apple a Day"" is a very catchy song; their music both melodic and complex. Their other two at least as strong. 
 
 All in all a fine collection of music from the 1968-69 psychedelic years in British pop-music.

195,"Winterheart's Guild(2003). Sonata Arctica's third studio album.
 
 Unlike most people on this site apparently, I DON'T hate power metal. I'm not one who slags the whole genre off upon the discovery of other music like progressive rock and other styles like a lot of people do. When I first came across the genre years ago, I was in heaven. There were a lot of really cool albums by bands like Stratovarius, Labyrinth, Dream Evil, Blind Guardian, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, and others that brought forth the nostalgic sounds of some of my favorite 80s metal bands, though with the benefit of modern production technology. Sure, the subject matter among many of these bands can come across as goofy (almost bearing a Manowar quality at times), but most people seem to miss the point that none of it is meant to be taken seriously.
 
 Of course, my interest in Power Metal has waned since then, but only because after a while, most of the bands I came across started to sound a lot alike with very little to separate them apart from others and make me want to come back for more. It seemed like all the bands had the same machine-gun double bass drumming, Malmsteen-inspired guitar solos, harpsichord keyboard soloing, and Geoff Tate-inspired singing. In short, I needed more _variety_.
 
 Thankfully, bands like Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, and Nightwish are around to show the rest how to make a good, memorable band.
 
 To me, Sonata Arctica sounds like a bigger, better, more realized Stratovarius. I'd known about the band for a while, and I've always loved the song 'Power Of One' off of Silence(2001) which was my first introduction to them. I finally saw one of their albums in the store the other day, and since I'm always looking for good music, I figured ""why not?"". After listening to this album several times now, I can honestly say that this was one of the best purchases I've made all year. While I do like Stratovarius, the problem I had with them is that their albums would have a couple of really outstanding songs on them, followed by several by-the-numbers tracks which they've formulated to death over and over again. Sonata Arctica has no problems like this. This band takes Stratovarius's sound as a main template, and infuses their own creative songwriting melodies and lyrical topics into it, creating a very memorable and varitable collection of songs. Their singer has that familiar Finnish accent, though it's combined with a real passionate performance. The guitarist always seems to play the right riff at the right time, varying it up from soulfull crunchy riffs to great solos that bring Glen Tipton of Judas Priest to mind. Keyboards go from solo-esque battles to goosebump-inducing atmospheric passages that compliment the melodies.
 
 Picking out favorite tracks on this album is a very difficult thing to do, but the ones that seem to stand out the most are 'APBE', 'Gravenimage', 'The Cage', 'Silver Tongue', 'Champaign Bath', and 'Broken'. 'APBE' and 'The Cage' are two of the fast speed metal tracks, while 'Gravenimage' and 'Broken' both sport unique, melodic overtones to them. 'Champaign Bath' is fast, fun metal that takes you for a hellova ride. Then there's two nice ballads to top the album off: 'The Misery' and 'Draw Me'. These ballads thankfully aren't syrup-drenched like a lot of ballads can get. There aren't any bad tracks in the bunch, and there's something to please anyone that is looking for variety.
 
 Replayability: High. Makes for a perfect power metal fix.
 
 WG proved to be a great starting point for me, and I highly suggest anyone else who sees this album in the stores to give it a shot. They also have a new album out, Reckoning Night(2005) as well as two earlier albums, Ecliptica(1999) and Silence, which many consider their best work. If WG is any indication, then I can't wait any longer to hit up on the other albums. One of the lyrics in the song 'Gravenimage' asks ""Can I still recognize a beautiful melody?"". Yes, you certainly can, and you're certainly one of the best bands in the business at it. 
 
 Other recommendations:
 -Any other Sonata Arctica album. ALL are outstanding. (judging by the soundclips)
 -'Visions' by Stratovarius
 -'Epica' and 'The Black Halo' by Kamelot
 -'Oceanborne', 'Wishmaster', and 'Century Child' by Nightwis

So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me

204,"I bought this album when I was 17. I'm now 31 and I still haven't recovered! This album, as said before, represents the indie punk ideal only feinted at by Nirvana, Sonic Youth etc. Steve Albini and co assault you here with a white-hot mind-melting onslaught  of musical savagery, from the beserk guitar-driven Colombian Necktie through the nosebleed-inducing Pavement Saw to the juddering, sinister colossus of Tiny, King of the Jews. Sheer uncompromising overbuilt punk, this represents Big Black at their zenith. With bands like this in the world there's no excuse for mediocrity
",5
205,"If forced to pick one band that best exemplified the indie-rock aesthetic, one would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than Big Black.  Many of the acts typically credited with bringing alternative music to the mainstream have, for better or worse, been little more than angry pop acts (Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails being prominent examples), and even many more underground acts such as Pixies, Sonic Youth, and the Jesus Lizard released some material that was palatable to the mainstream, as their major-label runs attest.  Big Black, on the other hand, was the real deal, a band that lived out the indie philosophy in both their music and in their resolutely do-it-yourself business practices, and paid the commercial price for it.  Songs About F***ing was the perfect distillation of leader Steve Albini's philosophy: an abrasive, confrontational album that contained no concessions to the mainstream and no pretensions to socially redeeming value.  This is music at its most twisted and evil, acknowledging no taboos as it challenged listeners to take or leave its assaultive sound and unpleasant lyrical content.  
 
 The key to the lasting appeal of this release lies largely in its simplicity.  Like fellow pioneering noise-merchants Godflesh, Big Black distilled rock music to its most basic elements: guitar, bass, and drum machine.  In spite of this minimal approach, however, Songs About F***ing is hardly palatable or unchallenging.  What emerges from this combination of rock's traditional elements is a barrage of scathing, disembowling noise that pummels eardrums with a mix of astringent guitar squalls and pulsating industrial beasts.  And of course, it's all topped off with the demented vocal stylings of Albini himself, making Kurt Cobain sound like Mel Torme as he howled and screamed his tales of depravity.  
 
 Mixing metal, punk, and the then-burgeoning genre of industrial with reckless abandon, Songs About F***ing constitutes a musical roller coaster of frightening proportions, and wraps things up in barely half an hour.  The basslines and drum programming of Bad Penny and Colombian Necktie are enough to crack skulls, while Albini's vocals legitimately bring to mind a man in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  L-Dopa is all punkish speed and aggression but infinitely more frightening, and the proto-industrial rage of Precious Thing and Kasimir N. Pulaski Day would send Trent Reznor up a tree.  Even when the band slows down, as on Kitty Empire, the results are clenched, sinister, and intense.  Tiny, King of the Jews (love that title) actually manages to be somewhat atmospheric, but it still relies heavily on that mix of disconcerting guitar noise and pulsating beats.
 
 I've listened to pretty much every noted act in the extreme-music world, from Slayer to Godflesh to Meshuggah, and Big Black may have been the scariest of all.  And Songs about F***ing in an unqualified triumph, one that oozes menace and integrity at the same time.  Own it, or pose

I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song. The rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while Liebert &quot;jams,&quot; using the same trite, tired riffs. BORING

They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, ""Oh, THIS won't be jazz."" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found ""Prime"" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the ""smooth jazz"" airways.

214,"Wow! What a horrible album! Its tracks are filled with a bunch of predictable outcomes and very cheesy vocals. The only two tunes that I have found to be interesting were Eleven and Sydney. Eleven is actually my favourite tune. Gabriel & Dresden had the potential as they made some quality productions - although most of them were a bit too commercial, but still quility - throughout years 2002-2004. Then they released the awesome, their best in my opinion, track Arcadia. After the release of Arcadia, I just thought it couldn't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works. But the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two. And this album just proves it. All of these tracks are well done and finished, but too finished and too uncreative. It actually didn't surprise me after hearing their Essential Mix back in spring. Basically they have great production skills but absolutely no ideas. I would recommend just buying track Eleven on 12"" or mp3

216,"The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating.  Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie. 
 
  This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes.  As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present.  All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody.  Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more.  Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.
 
 However, the overall impression is that of boredom.  The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality.  Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.
 
 The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess.

222,"Rippington's during the period Moonlighting was made were the epitomy of Jazz fusion with latino flair. Fusion today is milk toast compared to this CD. ""Soft Jazz""  has become the term for bands and artists of this genre, and it fits. All radio friendly and crossover hopeful. This CD smokes with vibes, fast guitar, syncapated rythyms, and memorable melodies. Toe tapping and should be played twice in a row to let it sink in. Russ Freeman is the most under-rated jazz guitarist of his time. He is never mentioned with Carlton, Rit, Lorber, Dimeola,etc..... He is a great songwriter and his music appeals to all that listen, old and young alike.....

223,"The greatest thing about this LP is the songwriting.  Sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing, dealing with mortality and being average.  I think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on Other Songs he creates a great diversity and depth.  Mitchell Froom's production is perfect for the songwriting (it's almost as good as Kiko)

224,"What more is there to say about Danny Elfman's Batman score?  It's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time.  Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said ""listen to this music in the opening credits Riley"".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.  
 What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a ""dark superhero theme"", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation.
 What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion.
 cheers

225,"If you happen upon the video for MakeDamnSure and the sound on your television is off, then you would think that the band Taking Back Sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune.  They look like the MC5 in the video, jumping off amps, winging guitars around there head, looking serious as all hell.  But if your like me and you turn the sound back on, your going to hear that it's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important.  
 
 I was asked to listen to this by one of my friends.  I gave it an honest to god listen, but I couldn't handle it for too long.  Being earnest is fine, but stop with this emo stuff.  You'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it's all the same. If you like emo, please, buy 13 Songs by Fugazi.

 Four tracks came from this wonderful CD.  Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, ""Girl In The Red Dress"" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, ""First Flight Home"" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, ""Corner Club"" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, ""Isabella"".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks ""what exactly is smoothjazz?""  Play ""Isabella"" for them.  They'll understand.

233,"Check out Augustana, without doubt last year's most promising new band, completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that'd be Epic, which has been in a tailspin since Polly Anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist.  Their debut album, the extraordinary All the Stars and Boulevards, was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and, minus even a modicum of press or publicity, got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases; its soaring title track -- one of `05's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy.  So how's this for a dark horse story?  Practically as an afterthought as spring closed, Epic chose as Boulevards' second single the wistful, resplendent ""Boston"" and then sat on their dead, numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band's twenty-one-year-old (!) lead singer Dan Layus (think 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold with a more agile voice, and much much cuter) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily, week on week, against all conventional wisdom which states that summer, with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments, is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex, chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation, and whose back half, in lieu of a repetitive refrain, rockets to a soul-cleansing, cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings.  Now there's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that Epic re-released Boulevards last week with extra tracks, an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me, if for no other reason than I'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin' record, and that's what they count on, but if it helps Augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be, all will be forgiven.

239,"I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. ""Outshined"" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:
 
 1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great;
 Chris Cornell hits some great notes too.
 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell.
 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out.
 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks 
 a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good.
 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end.
 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some ""screamage"".
 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating ""The devil sounds like this"" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too.
 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5
 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly.
 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good.
 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment)
 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!

247,"Mid Eighties SST indie rock classic! This was the very first Sonic Youth album I owned. I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is ""Expressway to yr Skull,"" aka ""Madonna, Sean and Me,"" aka  ""The crucifixion of Sean Penn."" Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off. 
 While ""Expressway"" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like ""In the Kingdom #19,"" with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and ""Marilyn Moore,"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as ""Sister"" at first, because many of the songs aren't as ""immediately accessible"" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period. Buy it, it's magical.

The album sounds so boring, and the performances sound so uninspiring. Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap!  There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs.  And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff? If Chicago, with their extensive catalog, even thinks about performing one song from this album live, you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions.  They are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in 1991!

255,"I saw one of their music videos playing at Walmart and thought to myself: This is really cool!  Another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of Evanescence.  I happen to be a big fan of Evanescence and I LIKE the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative.  Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.  
 
 To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.

260,"I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.
 
 I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what ""Dirty Harry"" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?  
 
 I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.  
 
 I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his ""music"" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.   
 
 While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.  
 
 I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.
 
 I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.
 
 Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?  
 
 Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.

 Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note.

265,"This album is fantastic.  I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:
 
 1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and
 
 2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.
 
 My thoughts on both:
 
 The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.
 
 The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.
 
 
 All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to ""The Hawk"" just TEARS!!!
 
 I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.
 
 I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.
 
 Take their self titled album (or ""Lysol"" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.
 
 So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like ""A Senile Animal"" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.
 
 So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.
 
 And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.
 
 
 
 As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?
 
 Its inhuman

267,"Yes, I was once like you.  Enraptured by XTC's more lush productions like Skylarking.  But maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to GO 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour.  Pure, raw, creative energy captured on tape.  This is what Andy and Colin are capable of when not distracted by their more Beatlesque leanings.  There are lots of good tunes on the later albums, of course.  Drums and Wires and English Settlement are personal favorites.  But XTC never exploded with this level of combustion again

268,"if you knew me, you would probably know that i love punk music....old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was THE punk label..you know, the label with all the re-mastered classics, plus phenomenal newer acts 
 
 anyways, until recently, this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves...mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as ""Punk."" yes, this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo, but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched ""punk o rama"" since they contain very little punk. 
 
 epitaph has a great extension in Hellcat Records to appease the punks/skins...i would surely recommend that someone pick up the ""give em the boot"" compilations if they want punk rock.
 
 now, the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find! 
 
 bottom line, if you want punk go to hellcat, if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this, the new phase of punk o rama. 2 stars because i dont really care for this, but it earns my respect

269,"I have downloaded all of Black Label Society's albums, and even Book of Shadows and Pride & Glory, but this was the first album i bought in stores. I am a die hard Zakk Wylde fanatic, so, naturally, i love this CD. It combines Zakk's heavy riffs, with his soft melodies like the ones from Book of Shadows, and of course, his ripping solos. I believe that Zakk Wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time. If you are a first time Black Label listener, however, I would not reccomend this CD. In order to fully appreciate Black Label Society, you need to start off with Sonic Brew, or Stronger Than Death. Some good songs on those CD's are: Bored To Tears, Lowdown, Beneath the Tree, 13 Years of Grief, and Love Reign Down.

But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed.

274,"I can't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds! SOUL ASYLUM released an absolute winner with ""Hang Time"", a perfect blend of pop, punk and metal. With ""And the Horse They Rode in On"", I am truly baffled as to what happened. First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. ""Spinning"" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the ""Hang Time"" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called ""sell out"" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!! Sad but true, but what's even sadder is that Dave Pirner is actually a good songwriter and I'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out

275,"I would have ordered this soundtrack except I actually took the time to check out the list of ""songs"" that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews.  Sure enough, it was exactly as I thought myself....there was only one song that I actually recognized from the movie itself, Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"", which is a good song, but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself, but NOT in the actual ""SOUNDTRACK""!  What's up with that???  Great movie, great songs, should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans, but it does not.  Too bad.  I understand that the person who wrote the actual ""musical score"" for the movie wants his due, but the fans want ""their"" music, too.  Do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie?

276,"I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one.  NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote.  I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled.  They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all.  This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst.  I know some might disagree, and that's fine.  I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards.  Sorry NFG!  I still love you!

279,"This was the most sophisticated popular music that I heard when I was young.  Joshua Rifkin, who also plays piano rags by Scott Joplin on another record, arranged and conducted this music.  ""Both Sides Now"" (win and lose are a strange trip in this song) was a hit on the radio for years, competing with ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""Pretty Ballerina"" by The Left Banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music.  I soon bought THE JUDY COLLINS SONGBOOK with 55 songs that included eight of the songs on ""Wildflower.""
 
 The first musical thing I notice about these songs now is how often I hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes.  The first song, ""Michael from Mountains"" by Joni Mitchell is in the key of E-flat, with a short introduction that repeats F G F G F G in the treble clef before Judy Collins starts singing those notes.  The second song, ""Since You've Asked"" by Judy Collins, which seems to be in E-minor, starts with an E and D alternating an octave higher over an E-minor7th chord, dropping through B-minor to a C chord with E D E D E D E in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to ""Michael ..."" but with enough G, A sus.4, D9, A-minor7th, and B chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music.  The words on such simple lines, ""Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood, All the willow winding paths leading up and outward, This is what I give . . . "" are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen.
 
 ""Sisters of Mercy"" by Leonard Cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and French horns.  There is certainly more going on than I can describe.  Judy Collins had done ""Suzanne"" on an earlier album, ""In My Life,"" and the combination of Judy singing Leonard Cohen songs worked so miraculously that ""Wildflowers"" took it in a very religious direction.  ""Priests"" has 7 verses, with the third verse:
 
 And who will shoot the arrow
 That men will follow through your grace.
 And when I'm Lord of memories
 And all your armor has turned to lace.
 
 The music seems a lot more complicated than a trill, possibly in B-flat-minor, with the notes between the staffs alternating between B-flat and A-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to C-flat.
 
 If you have never heard ""La Chanson des Vieux Amants"" by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest, you might not realize how sophisticated French popular songs had been before this album pushed American radio up to international standards.  Big bands had been popular once in the United States, and American music during World War II might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer, but I lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that, when Perry Como and Dean Martin could have used a few more hits.  There are some distinct instrumental voices which make the Brel song on ""Wildflowers"" interesting, but Brel often worked with Gerard Jouannest to achieve musical complexity.  So I suspect that this version is notable because Judy Collins' French is so beautiful.  The final song in her songbook, ""My Father,"" (on the ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" album) is about ""My father always promised us that we would live in France,"" and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world.  Contemplating intense desire is inspiring, but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly.  ""Oh, mon amour, Mon doux, mon tendre, mon verveilleux amour, ...""
 
 ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"" is a beautiful song by Leonard Cohen, soft with sorrow but Hey . .

286,"BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album ""Behind the Front"" and even their Sophomore album ""Bridging the Gap"" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.
 
 After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.
 
 Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go

287,"I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.
 
 Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.
 
 I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better

His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through.

Understanding Herbert's classical piano background, I expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone, but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used.  The first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals, which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic.  The rhythms were also boring, none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat, but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a Casio keyboard.

 i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. .. 
 
 i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album ""tear drops and closed caskets"" 
 
 the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song
 
 the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.
 
 in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out. 
 
 3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. "" small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets"". 
 
 the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it. 
 
    In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment.
 the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.
      after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.
 
 what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets

While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is ""Daydreaming"", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible

304,"So you wanna have music on that provides some real audio comfort, music that has some very cool rhythms, music that is well-orchestrated and textured, well search no more for Plush delivers on all levels, it is a lovely mix of music in the so-called ""downtempo"" vein but it is really above and beyond just the latest kind of thing, instead it is a combination of some very sexy music that exemplifies the best in current trends in music! I found it to be wonderful for playtime and my lover agreed with some stunning sonic cues to me as the disc unwound the first time we had it on as we got it on! It is certainly a great disc for the romantically inclined although it is good enough to be just darn good without having to occupy anything specific by way of description since it rolls easily all the way from the very cool to the beautifully hot. I could wax on about my fave tracks but I actually love them all, it is a well put together set and has that magical sort of flow from track to track. You should try it on for love, don't even say a word to your sweetie, just put forward your best kiss and let the disc play, Plush indeed

306,"This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made.  The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think.  the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are:
 Disc 1:
 8. Halifax - ""sydney""
 11. Say Anything - ""Woe""
 15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - ""The best happiness money can buy""
 56. Patent Pending - ""Los Angeles""
 
 Disc 2:
 1. Hellogoodbye - ""Homewrecker""
 5. Jack's Mannequin - ""Kill the messenger""
 8. Matchbook Romance - ""My Eyes Burn""
 
 Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion

311,"I saw a great show at Fishlips in Bakersfield last Wednesday: Wayne ""The Train"" Hancock. He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass.
 
 Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few.
 
 I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now. 
 
 The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too.

318,"Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves. 
 
 As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation. 
 
 There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best.

This is far from generic, as some of the other reviewers has blatantly stated, although some of the songs do sound run-of-the-mill and dry in places. Overall, though, this album is full of creative melodies and structures that you just don't find now-a-days in the 'nu-metal' scene. Don't settle for the garbage that's out there, this is a talented band with a unique sound [those guitars!] and a great album.

 From the opening of I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Bye Bye Badman to I Am The Ressurection and the bonus track on this disc Fool's Gold. What most impresses me about this album is it's ability to not only keep your intention for 10 minutes plus (Both Fool's Gold and I Am The Ressurection push double figures) and still leave you yearning for more like The Velvet Underground's I'm Waiting For The Man you could just keep listening for hours.

329,"High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle ""Parklife"", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown. 
 
 But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.
 
 The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like ""This Is a Low"" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.
 
 It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish

330,"Whatever happened to melody, creativity, individuality and good old  beats?  Somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who can't sing, write or play an instrument, songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel.  Fortunately the Eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original, quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times.  (""Sweet Things"" is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so.) The haunting voice, odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner.  My grade:

331,"They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype ""punk"" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see ""alternative"" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other ""serious"", ""sensitive"" ""hip"" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days).

332,"Hey, what's up? This is my first review. At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.
 
 This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).
 
 Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique

334,"'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.
 
 To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful ""Fool on the Hill,"" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's ""I am the Walrus"" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  ""Flying"" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, ""Your Mother Should Know,"" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including ""When I'm Sixty Four"" and ""Honey Pie"".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, ""Blue Jay Way"".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.
 
 The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  ""Hello/Goodbye"" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  ""All You Need Is Love"" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  ""Baby You're a Rich Man,"" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.
 
 Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.

340,"Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980. 
 The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes a more important live document of the band, indeed. 
 Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century(the spirited opener School, Bloody Well Right, Hide in Your Shell, Asylum, Dreamer, Rudy and the closing Crime of the Century which closes this live album), three songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (Ain't Nobody But Me, A Soapbox Opera and Two of Us), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments(From Now On and Fool's Overture), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America(the monster hit The Logical Song, the title cut and the Top 20 smash Take The Long Way Home) plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis? What Crisis?. 
 Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/vocalist Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards, additional backing vocals and band MC(he does the stage bantering here, especially his humorous intro to Breakfast in America), drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. 
 Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is played at a faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section. 
 Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts(going Gold right away) and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album. 
 Highly recommended!

343,"I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.
   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.  
 
 I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much ""pop"", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about ""different"", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.  
 
 Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called ""keyboard solo"" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.  
 
 I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.  
 
 Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from ""good"" to ""great"".  
 
 Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)

344,"I liked the other BRMC albums a lot as well, but I think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever, but after a few listens it got kinda tired...  Still good, but you'd think ""oh yeah...""
 
 Howl is the opposite.  It was OK the first time I listened to it, and I kinda liked it, but it didnt really dig it's claws into me.  For that reason it didn't get pulled out of the CD wallet all that often.  Then I put it in one day and thought ""ya know, this is actually pretty good.""   Then I started listening to it some more and thought ""man, this is really, really good!""  Guess what?  Now I love it...  This is definitely a creeper CD, as in - it creeps up on you (yeah, that was a stoner analogy.)  
 
 I think ""weight of the world"" is the best song on the CD, but ""howl"" had really grown on me too - but I don't want to harp on the songs too much, this is an album as a whole.  Bands grow up and change, and I'm glad to see that BRMC has done it, and done it well.  They haven't lost their muse or gotten ""softer"" just to try something different -- they've grown and changed and their music shows it.  I remember my freshman year in college when Achtung Baby came out and there were people saying stuff like ""boycott U2 cuz they're sellouts!"" - not realizing that AB would be looked at as probably the most insightful, clever, and musically interesting album of their catalog.  That's what the backlash to Howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate.  
 
 Yeah, people may fear change, and admittedly, some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process (Chris Gaines, anyone...) but BRMC has actually grown, and if you liked their first 2 CD's I'd say give this one a shot.  It's really good - and I'm proud of 'em for making it.

If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever"" on msn

348,"Pat Benatar is a natural. This compilation has been thoroughly reviewed, so I will focus on four very different songs. Her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on ""Heartbreaker,"" a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy. In ""I need a lover,"" she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music. ""We Live For Love,"" is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us. This one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day. ""Hell Is For Children,"" a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse. It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in ""Love Is A Battlefield."" She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws

350,"The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for ""Once Upon a Time in America"" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released

351,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.

352,"Obviously Mr. T. Hardin is suffering from some musical mental problems. He would apparently refer the knuckle-dragging, amateurish, talentless stylings of the hundreds of bands that play the same three notes a thousand beats per minute while some oaf screams and growls unintelligible garble supposedly using all sorts of elaborate words for 'kill' that neither the band nor the fans know how to use or say properly.
 OK, now that I've gotten that rant over with, let me continue on to what you really want to read. This was actually the very first Manowar album I heard. A friend picked it up the day it came out, let me borrow it after he listened to it once, and never got it back (sorry Darren). I was forever hooked. The first half of the album is classic, well produced, straight ahead metal. Fantastic, clear solos on each song. The title track is a classic Manowar anthem. It sums up what they are quite well. 'Blow Your Speakers' is not only another trademark metal anthem, but is also the closest Manowar has gotten to an actual ""hit"" in the U.S. ""Carry On"", one of my instant favorites, is and inspirational rally cry; the kind Manowar is known for, among other things. ""Violence and Bloodshed' is a fast and furious return to the Heavy Metal beginnings and Vietnam theme that hasn't been seen since the first album ""Battle Hymns"". All in all the first half of this album is just in your face heavy metal. 
 The second half is a return to the days of long, long ago. 'Defender' is one of the last things that the late, great Orson Welles ever did before his passing. I listened to this track at least 200 times in the first week I had this album. It aptly sets the tone for the rest of the record. A rich narrative that opens to a powerful crash of truly heavy metal. From this point on, this album does it all. Beautifully clear and powerful bass lines. Articulate and soaring lead solos. Earth shaking Drums. And the absolute best vocals on any recording of the time. 'Drums of Doom' pounds you into 'Holy War' like a charging team of mammoth beasts which then throws you into the 'Master of Revenge', a mystical segue into 'Black Wind, Fire and Steel' which blinds all with the relentless speed and accuracy of both music and lyrics. All done at a rate that almost defies logic. Manowar have definitely cemented there place as the Kings of Metal with this album forevermore. All those who refuse to believe it can go back their amateurs and goons. Leave us and make room for the true men of heavy metal.

353,"It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the ""new"" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection.

355,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.
 
 The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album. 
 
 There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.
 
 This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat.

Matter of fact, he sounds more like watered down Keith Jarrett-nothing very original going on here. And if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you're doing-guess what-you ain't doing squat. As a pianist who's been playing modern jazz for 40 years, I can tell you to sit this set out. And if you want Bill Evans or Keith Jarrett, go get the real thing.

Kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and  wild multi-colored hair. I listened to ""Kaleidoscope"" so much that I got sick of it and sold it. Big mistake! I want it back and I can't seem to find it anywhere. ""Kaleidoscope"" is definetly a good R&B album and my favorite songs are ""Caught Out There,"" ""Game Show,"" ""Suspended,"" ""Ghetto Children,"" ""Roller Rink,"" and the Spanish-esque ""I Want Your Love."" This CD also exposed me to The Neptunes and their signature sound, which is well known by now. Overall, this is very good music

364,"Any moderate fan of The Scarlett Pimpernel, musical, book or movie(s) should own this cd. I absolutely love the songs ""Believe"" and ""Vivez"" which are not on the Encore cd, and this disk is worth owning for them alone. I'm not crazy about Chauvlin's voice on this disk, which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times. For great Chauvlin tracks (like Where's the Girl) you definatly need to buy the Encore cd. Christine Andreas's renditions of ""Only Love"" and ""You Are My Home"" are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the Encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show.

365,"This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.  
 
 It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.
 
 There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard ""wheel"" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket. 
 
 Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.
 
 Friends has nice ""happy"" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.
 
 Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.
 
 Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.
 
 Out on the Tiles is another rocker.
 
 Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.
 
 Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.
 
 That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.
 
 Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.
 
 Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people ""in the know"".
 
 All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.

368,"Waller and Armstrong were of the same generation and were collaborators in music in the 1920s. Louis's first big leap to popular stardom beyond the tight group of Jazz musicians and performers came when he introduced ""Ain't Mis Behavin'"" on the Broadway stage. The audiences often forced him to do three or four encores.  Folks who had seen the show before would pay full price just to get in to hear Louis sing this one song.
 
    The recordings in the late 20s by Louis with all the vocals are simply my idea of the best music ever recorded by anyone. Rather than get them selected this way, you might want to get one of the CDs or collections that covers that period of time with everything, rather than just the songs by Waller. 
  Likewise, while the All Stars were not as good as his original Chicago and New York Groups, particularly these later all-stars (I prefer the albums with the great Jack Teagarden), if you get into the music you will want that all too.
 
      At any rate, there is no one else but Louis who can do these songs justice except the Fat man himself, Mr. Waller

369,"Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness

Nonetheless, Crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish. It should have gone a trillion times platinum, but hey he will get his recognition in due time. Amen to that. Ok, 7 days is mainly a celebration ablum, after all God did create everything in 7 days and that is something to celebrate about, with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place. Don't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier. Just imagine ""God is Good"" mixed with ""Unity"" mixed with ""God didn't give up on me"" through a whole album. This is the best way to explain it. Deitrick my friend, you are my favorite Gospel artist and truely annointed. I thank God for you everyday, Amen to that. Thank you Deitrick for obeying the Lords will to make wonderful music and most of all I thank God for creating you to make this wonderful music. All Glory is yours Jesus! Amen and Amen.

371,"I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids.
 
 This record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.
 
 This album does not rock. Period

372,"For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too

382,"The Alice Cooper Band's second album sees the band still recording for Frank Zappa's label.  The music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous.  No real macabre stuff yet, but the album is definitely a progression from their first one.  The album was produced by David Brigs who is probably best known for working with Neal Young.  The opening track, ""Mr. And Misdemeanor"" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words.  ""Shoe Salesman"", ""Below Your Means"", ""Return Of The Spiders"", and the short but cool ""Refrigerator Heaven"" are all good tunes.  The finale of ""Beautiful Flyaway"" and ""Lay Down And Die, Goodbye"" is also a great way to end things.  The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release.  ""Easy Action"" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point.

Louis' scratchy, gruff, yet likeable an' melodic croon an' Ella's smooth-as-silk, soothing an' intoxicating voice incredibly, to me, go PERFECTLY on these duets here.  From that first opener 'Let's Call the Whole Thing off', done so sly an' flirtatious on both parts, to 'Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You' to the ever-engaging 'Autumn in New York' and 'Stars Fell on Alabama' one of the GREATEST standards EVER written (""And in the center just you and me, My heart beat like a hammer, My arms wound around you tight, And stars fell on Alabama last night"").  THAT is what romance is, kiddies!  Oh, an' I can't forget 'Summertime'.  Ahhh, yes, 'Summertime', with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love, happiness, sunlights an' flowers; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted.  Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'; ""there he goes, layin' it on thick again.""  Well, I can't help it.  In a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music I've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years, it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who TRULY appreciate talent and genius.

She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.

395,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.
 
 It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.
 
 The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.
 
 Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.
 
 Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...
 
 Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.
 
 Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.
 
 Track 5 - Ugh.
 
 Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...
 
 Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.
 
 Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?
 
 Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.
 
 Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.
 
 Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.
 
 Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.
 
 Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.
 
 Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...
 
 Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.
 
 Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.
 
 Flame away, kiddies.

397,"If this album had ""Desperately"" on it from ""Stick It To Ya"", I would've bought it in a second.  That's the best song on that album, a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless.  And with 8 tunes coming from that album (as well as 8 from its follow up ""The Wild Life""), you would've thunk that ""Desperately"" would've made the cut over ho-hum songs like ""She Wants More"" or ""You Are The One"".  As such, skip this one, the songs from ""The Wild Life"" aren't that great anyway.  Get ""Stick It To Ya"" instead, it's a better best-of Slaughter collection than this one

 Of course ""Jukebox"" makes you want to dance no matter where you are. But if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor.
 
 Bent Fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back.
 
 The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is pretty short. Even with it being padded out with a few remixes (which are good and appreciated) this runs under 60 minutes. On the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks.
 
 Don't get me wrong, this album is worth your money, especially if you are a fan of dance/DJ music. Very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe

With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album.  Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album.  His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction.  Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure.  His ""Cat Handcuffs"" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity.  I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style.

My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab ""State of Shock"" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  ""Torture"" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  ""Body"" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster ""The Hurt.""  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it.

414,"While Neil has written and recorded a wealth of outstanding material throughout his career, his albums have tended to be a bit uneven.  Perhaps that's why there are so many Neil Diamond compilation albums on the shelf these days.  This collection culls the best selections from his late 60s and early 70s UNI/MCA albums.  In fact, this set is essentially an expanded version of the now out-of-print His 12 Greatest Hits.  And while that album supplanted the studio versions of Sweet Caroline and Holly Holy with strong live versions from Hot August Night, this collection restores the original studio recordings.  Hot August Night, Neil's last MCA album before leaving for Columbia, is represented with the stellar live version of Cherry, Cherry.  But as good as that version is, I would have dropped it (along with the cover of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother) for Cold Water Morning, Glory Road and Two-Bit Manchild.  That's a minor quibble though, as this set does contain all of the essential recordings from the period in breathtakingly pristine sound quality.
 
 Several reviewers have complained about the lack of certain songs (Heartlight, Kentucky Woman, Thank the Lord for the Night Time, etc.).  For the record, this is a compilation of Neil's best work from his UNI/MCA recording era (1968-1972).  The early singles (Thank the Lord for the Night Time, Kentucky Woman, Solitary Man and the original studio version of Cherry, Cherry) were recorded for Bang Records in 1966 and 1967.  The best collection of the early Bang Records material is Classics: The Early Years.  America and Love on the Rocks were recorded for Capitol while most later era songs like September Morn, If You Know What I Mean and Heartlight were recorded for Columbia (beginning with the Jonathan Livingston Seagull album in 1973).  The best single-disc collection of Neil's Columbia material is probably 12 Greatest Hits, Volume II.  Fans interested in purchasing a career spanning retrsopective may be tempted to buy Greatest Hits 1966-1992 or The Essential Neil Diamond but both of those compilations suffer from the inclusion of inferior live versions of in place of the original studio recordings.  The career spanning box set, In My Lifetime, largely avoids the live version replacement issue that plagues other compilations but it suffers from its own share of problems, namely an abundance of mildly interesting (but ultimately unnecessary) rarities.
 
 The most efficient method of compiling your own triple disc, career spanning box set is to purchase these three titles: Classics - The Early Years [Neil's Bang Records recordings from 1966-1967], The Neil Diamond Collection [the UNI/MCA sampler reviewed above], and 12 Greatest Hits Volume II [the best of the Capitol and Columbia years].

 Root kit
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
 A root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system. These tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes. Root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows.
 
 A rootkit typically hides logins, processes, files, and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard. In many sources, rootkits are counted as trojan horses.

 In this instance, Sony installs DRM software to copy protect their CD, and prevent it from being copied to various devices, all the while not telling you, the user, or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and Windows. Manually trying to uninstall it like some people have done, results in their CD-Rom drives disappearing entirely from Windows, as Sony installs their own custom CD-Rom drivers onto the system.

416,"Although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work, with the exception of BluePrint which is a classic and in a class of its own, I wasn't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general. He should've retired after Blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop. The Black Album was alot better than the BluePrint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90% filler. 
 While this album shows a more storytelling, poet side of Jay-Z, it ain't exactly his best work. Actually this falls down at the bottom, right beneath his 1997 Vol 1 album. While his maturity as an artist has improved, his lyrical content has suffered. The first 5 songs are classic Jay-Z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of MC such&such. In my opinion, he has faltered quite a bit on this album, this is right under BluePrint2; BluePrint2 should've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic. Kingdom Come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at Lost One, then coming back with Minority Report and ending altogether with Beach Chair, which could've had a better song title given the point of the song. Beyonce, Usher & Ne-Yo, John Legend and Chrisete could've been more utilized than singing hooks, let alone singing hooks on so-so songs. More thought could've been put into the album to make it a 3, and more could've been covered to make it a 4. But Jay is starting to let his Def Jam position affect him.

417,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.  
 
 The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.
 
 If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!

418,"Anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album. Sure, B.B. King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say ""oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling"". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of ""Help the Poor"", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like ""Play it all night!"" and ""Tell it, B.B.!"" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like ""Sweet Little Angel"", ""Worry Worry"", ""How Blue Can You Get"", and ""You Upset Me Baby"". An absolute must-have

The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.  
 
 This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's ""That'll Be The Day.""  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!  
 
 It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang ""I'll Get You"" at the London Palladium in 1963, and ""All My Loving"" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include:
 
 *One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970.
 *Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting.
 *How Do You Do It - the unreleased single.
 *Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece.

For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.

  Otherwise tunes like the catchy &quot;This Is Pop&quot; and the offbeat,
  quircky reggae of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; have more relation to not only early British invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of American avante rockers.Neither is this in any way typical XTC-in years to come the band would
  develope a sound much more melodic and sweet (neither of those
  terms ever apply to this music) but the stuttering vocals and
  Andy Partirdge's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.From a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally I find this album worth a listen-'White Music' will
  definately command your attention.And it's not too loud either

435,"Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass &quot;scene,&quot; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well...&quot;filler.&quot;  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the &quot;Prototype Years&quot; ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best

436,"Purple City's debut release is ""The Purple Album"" (2006). Having made their mark on the mixtape scene the Dipset affiliate trio of Emperor Shiest Bub, Un Kasa & Don Bishop Agallah provide this release. The Harlem trio start off the album with ""Live Your Life"" repping their group and thanking the Diplomats for paving the way, the best part of this track for me is the chorus. The typical ""Gangsta"" has Shiest Bub collaborating with Jim Jones and Max B backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep, the verses are equally boring. Laidback ""Fly High"" follows, backed by some mellow production Purple City pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut. I don't know if Purple City is paying tribute to the South movement, or trying to capitalize on it with ""Trap N****"" either way it's a weak attempt to sound like Young Jeezy, its actually disturbing. ""Go Head"" follows Purple City proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut. ""Nick Nack"" is a lame attempt at a club track, horrible chorus. Tec, Steele and Buckshot drop in for the grimy ""Hustlers"".  Agallah, Un Kasa and affiliate Ike Eyes  team up for another bland cut with ""Picture Me Rollin"". Shiest Bub collabs with A-Mafia on ""Head Bust Open"" rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with Purple City.  Purple City's decides to spell things out again on ""P.A.Y.D.A.Y."".  While ""Grind Slow"" feat. Buddy Klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies.  Shiest Bub closes the album off with ""Catch Him"" repping himself.  Lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them I feel like I have heard it all somewhere else before. None of them have distinct flows and production is average.  If you love Dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this. This may sound brutal but listening to the ""The Purple Album"" to me is like watching a bad B Movie, not worth my time.

 He captures the feel of his New York and you can visualise what the Dirty Boulevard looks like.
 Lou is at his best when he plays tough and on New York his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot. For Velvet's fans, im going to rate this 3rd of Lou's solo efforts behind Transformer and Take No Prisoners

438,"Mariah Carey's 1994 album Merry Christmas is the ultimate Christmas album.  She breathes new life into standard songs like Silent Night and Joy to the World.  Her voice is in peak form, hitting her five octave range - and I swear for this album - six.  
 
 On this new release, one side is a CD, the other has all her charming Christmas music videos.  The label warns that the CD side will not play in all CD players unless it is a Sony, but it played fine in my non-Sony CD walkman as well as my Gateway PC DVD player.  
 
 There are two engaging secular songs here, ""All I Want for Christmas is You,"" and ""Baby Please Come Home for Christmas.""  But the real power is in the classic hymns and carols.  Her versions are so full of joy and reverence for Jesus our Saviour.  I get tears in my eyes when I think of the Christ Child coming to Earth - the real reason for Christmas

439,"I have always loved Boz and everything he has produced so far.  So, when I read the reviews in preparation to purchase this album, I shook my head and said to myself, ""Some people are just way too picky!  How bad could the drums be?""  Well, I found out.  The drum track in this album ranges from ""mildly irritating"" to ""AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! Somebody shoot the drummer, please!""  The constant brushes on the cymbals on ALMOST EVERY SONG creates a background noise that makes you feel like you're listening to a radio station that isn't quite tuned in to the proper frequency.  I was SO disappointed, because Boz does such a beautiful job singing these lovely songs.  I can't make myself enjoy them, however, because I can't get my focus off of that freakin' drum noise!  So, if you think some of the previous reviewers are just trying to be a little aurally precious, I assure you that they have put forth valid points - points with which I sadly concur.  Can somebody tell Boz to remix this thing and cut out Irritating Cymbals Guy?  Sheesh.

440,"Some artists are good enough that to label one work as their best says more than a lot.  Nick Cave is by all means one of them.  And 'Your Funeral...My Trial' is that golden release.  Beginning with the slow title cut, it moves it's way through track after track, sometimes menacing, sometimes violent, sometimes beautiful, and always thought provoking and dark.  Highlights?  Honestly, all of them.  Warning, this album is Nick's least accesable and that says a lot too.  But after a few good listens, it works it's way into your brain and it's the best thing since ever- I promise

441,"When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style

443,"Playing Time - 39:05 -- Don Rigsby doesn't even turn the big 4-0 until February 28 of 2008. Already he has two decades of professional bluegrass experience with such top groups as Longview, Bluegrass Cardinals, J.D. Crowe & the New South, Lonesome River Band and Rock Country. He's also released four highly-acclaimed solo albums and was twice named SPBGMA's male vocalist for the year. When Rock Country disbanded, Don was faced with two choices - work for someone else, or form his own band. He chose the latter and, unlike previous solo albums from Rigsby (on the Sugar Hill label) that enlisted friends and session players, he has recorded ""Hillbilly Heartache"" with his own group (Midnight Call) that includes himself singing lead and playing mandolin, along with Dale Vanderpool (banjo), Shayne Bartley (guitar), Jesse Wells (fiddle), and Robert Maynard (bass). It was a good move to do it all themselves this time because it's a crackerjack band. 
 
 In a few instances, (Make God Laugh, Red Bird, Prisoner on the Highway), their vocal arrangements also call for Rigsby to jump up to tenor on the choruses. ""He Loves To Hear You Shout"" (written by Dixie and Tom T. Hall) is a very nicely presented vocal quartet for the group with Rigsby, Vanderpool, Bartley and Wells doing the vocalizing. 
 
 While best known for his mandolin picking, Don's a versatile multi-instrumentalist, and it's a treat to hear him also provide some snippets of guitar, mandele, and fiddle. Two songs (""These Golden Fields"" and ""Any Bar in Birmingham"") incorporate some of Don's light percussion. The former, about farming, features Don's high-lead singing with two harmonies below, as well as Wells' octave violin for a different mood. Obviously, quite a bit of forethought went into producing these songs in the best possible manner for us. In a few, the banjo is muted, and on the closing number, ""I Am The Man, Thomas"") Jesse Wells lays down his fiddle to provide clawhammer banjo as the only accompaniment for Don's voice. 
 
 Midnight Call's repertoire is drawn from some excellent songwriters (Shawn Camp, Marty Rabon, Jim Lauderdale, Mark Brinkman, Larry Shell, Kim Williams, Tim Stafford, and others). Bobby Cyrus is a co-writer of ""Big Jim."" I'm curious as to whether Big Jim is a fictional folkloric character or whether there was actually a man who sacrificed himself for others. You may recall that it was Cyrus who penned the reflective ""Carved Our Names in Stone"" that was sung solo by Rigsby on his last solo album, The Midnight Call. Farmers, family, life and love get ample coverage in the songs. For his song of home, he belts out an inspired rendition of Bill Monroe's ""Kentucky Waltz."" Another tale from that region is an intoxicating ""Daddy Was A Moonshine Man."" A standard instrumental, ""Forked Deer"" gallops along, but I hope their future projects introduce us to new tunes. Sung solo, ""Old Green Chevrolet"" relates a tale of a traveling preacher bringing the gospel to mountain folks, and I missed a little harmony on the choruses. 
 
 With ""Hillbilly Heartache,"" evocative messages get us thinking, smiling, contemplating, and even laughing when the intoxicating ""Daddy Was A Moonshine Man"" cues up. This Kentuckian clearly has strong mountain roots, and he knows what it takes to produce a very compelling bluegrass album. His reputation and dedication to traditional music, and his innovative vision for the future, are well documented. While he may have stretched boundaries a bit in the past, ""Hillbilly Heartache"" is simply a hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)

444,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.

448,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead

449,"I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.
 
 Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy

 CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: ""All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled.

460,"This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring

You can even attune to the atoning blood of Christ harmoniously exalted. 
 
 My only displeasure was found in the absence of sing along lyrics. To decipher all the stanzas, owning a hymnbook is a must. It is important to obtain one while supplies still exist...I am not completely kidding. My husband and I were at a used book sale where a man was overjoyed to actually find a hymnbook. He wanted to learn the comprehensive praises that are cunningly being pushed out the back door of most churches.

If you're new to FLA and this is the only one you have heard and you like the style then you might not like other FLA before this release.

The true Warren Zevon was a poet of sorts, a man who tackled difficult subjects (""Excitable Boy,"" for example, with a final verse that still gives me shivers), but still remained a sensitive man at heart (""Accidentally Like a Martyr,"" for example; don't deny, it moves you).

 Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.
 
 During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!

Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!
 
 DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem

481,"Sweet Surrender!!! that's the song that got me into bying this album, and what a album! On ""move with me"" he takes me on a ride in the same vibe as the stones have. ""Get on top"" equally great with his sex frustrated voice in peak condition. The flow on ""Hong Kong Bar"" is simulair to the feeling you get from the doors ""riders on the storm"" and closing Make it right is dramatic as few. There is a few not so brilliant songs but mixed up with these mindblowers that just dosent matter...If you love Jeff then learn to love..

 I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing.

488,"After Ja Rule rose in popularity throughout the years since his debut, ""Venni Vetti Vecci"" in 1999, now in 2003 lots of things have changed.  50 Cent and his G-Unit crew rose up from the streets of New York and took the rap game by storm and their goal was to destroy Ja Rule and expose him as a poser.  After numerous disses throughout the years when 50 and his clique were in the underground scene til 2003, Ja Rule's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes.  So with this release, ""Blood in My Eye,"" Ja is out to prove that he still got that gangsta s*** in him.  Can Ja turn his career back around or will it further put him in the grave?

 Ja Rule does indeed return to his roots.....somewhat.  Mostly every track has Ja spitting with anger dissing 50, Eminem, DMX, Dr. Dre and mostly every other rapper who dissed him.  He still got some pretty hot radio tracks but most of the album is filled with semi-hardcore tracks.  This was the first ""flop"" in Ja Rules career.  This album barely pushed over 400,000 units to date.  Still a pretty good record though, check it out

489,"It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.
 
 The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.
 
 That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.
 
 I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio

490,"""Honky Chateau"" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. ""Rocket Man"" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. ""Honky Cat"" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his ""redneck ways"" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song ""Mellow"", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice ""You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow"" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in ""I think I am going to Kill Myself"" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of ""Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues"", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with ""I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way"" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. ""Amy"" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice ""Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"". One of the ultimate classics is ""Mona Lisa"" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings ""Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you"" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, ""Hercules"" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a ""cat named Hercules"".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. ""Rocket Man"" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding ""Slave"" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.

491,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.
 
 I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.
 
 Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.
 
 Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.

498,"Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single ""song"" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review.
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like ""Drop a gem on them"" and ""Bloodsport"" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.
 
 I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost
