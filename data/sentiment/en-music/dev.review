1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.  
 
 Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway.

2,"I thought the album was boring.  I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists.  I bought the cd and loved the catchy song ""I Break Things"".  The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens.  I was disappointed in her cover of ""I'm Not Lisa""- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion.  She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material

4,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway

5,"A half century ago, I was a junior in high school. We used to have these gatherings called ""assemblies,"" where the principal would collect the entire student body in the auditorium (no excuses allowed!) for an event of more than passing importance. At this late date, I can only remember a small handful of them: the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, President Truman relieving General MacArthur of his command. Oh, and one where two fellows from Ampex came to our high school to give a little demonstration of something called ""stereophonic sound,"" using, needless to say, an Ampex tape recorder.
 
 And the music for this demonstration? It was the brief opening prologue (""Sunrise"") from Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" in this very same Reiner/Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording. This was a ""sneak preview to end all sneak previews,"" inasmuch as the monophonic LP (""New Orthophonic,"" I believe it was called) hadn't even been released at that early date. And, needless to say, this impressionable teenager was suitably impressed. So much so that, in the years to come, I acquired three LPs of the performance: the original monophonic LP, then the Living Stereo LP a few years later, and eventually, when the stereo LP had seen its better days, the Dynagroove rerelease (something I'd just as soon forget). I never did go the reel-to-reel route, and, when CDs eventually made their appearance, I opted for other performances of these two Strauss works rather than the earlier conventional Living Stereo CD release. But I always did have fond memories of that particular reel-to-reel tape demonstration back in '54; it was a direct copy of the 30ips master tape, and not the 7.5ips ""consumer"" version that came out shortly thereafter.
 
 With BMG now releasing half-century-old Living Stereo classics as hybrid SACDs (10 at present, with surely more on the way), it was easy for me to select this recording as one of the first to sample. I was more than pleasantly surprised; just listening to the ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" prologue had the effect of turning the clock back 50 years; truly a trip down Memory Lane!
 
 In a phrase, I wasn't disappointed. Even listening to the conventional CD layer, it was easy to get the sense that there I was again, listening to the 30ips master tape. Even with headphones, I heard no evidence of tape hiss; just beautifully balanced stereo sound with a tremendous sense of not only left-to-right spatial array but depth as well. (This is particularly evident in ""The hero's battlefield"" segment of ""Ein Heldenleben,"" where the initial muted trumpet fanfares sound as if they are coming from well behind the orchestra.) Throughout both massive tone poems, the music is well-served by RCA's ""minimalistic"" microphoning, with just two mikes picking up the sound field, and every single instrumental voice (and there are many of them) can clearly be heard. (Sir Thomas Beecham, that evergreen source of bon mots, reserved one of his best for ""Ein Heldenleben"" when he wrote that ""I once spent a couple of days in a train with a German friend. We amused ourselves by discovering how many notes we could take out of 'Ein Heldenleben' and leave the music essentially intact. By the time we finished we had taken out fifteen thousand."")
 
 As for Reiner's interpretations, perhaps the simplest way of putting it is that there is no time in the last half century that I can recall when these two performances were NOT included in EVERY ""essential recordings"" discography (even when the sound quality was not as it is here, in the hybrid SACD release). Reiner had a way of not oversentimentalizing these two works, as if they had been the products of one of the world's greatest egos, which, in fact, they were: Strauss made no bones about himself being the hero of ""Ein Heldenleben."" Reiner keeps things moving along, lest they bog down for the empty rhetoric that they can often be in lesser hands.
 
 A century ago, when Strauss had been the most famous composer who was also a conductor and Gustav Mahler had been the most famous conductor who was also a composer, audiences couldn't get enough of the Strauss tone poems. (I think, in fact, that the record will show that Mahler conducted Strauss's tone poems more frequently than he did his own symphonies!)
 
 And a half-century ago, when I had been in my musical adolescence, so to speak, I too couldn't get enough of them. But they haven't worn all that well in the intervening years. Now, considerably older and modestly wiser, I can only take them in infrequent doses. (Perhaps I've simply taken Strauss at his word when he described himself as ""a first-rate second-rate composer."") And, fortunately for this now-jaded me, these Reiner performances, long perfect in everything but sound quality, have arrived with, finally, sound quality that matches the performances.
 
 I have every expectation that future ""essential  recordings"" discographies will continue to include these performances, now with this newly-refurbished sound quality that is the match of any.

6,"I'm not usually a fan of ""power metal"", but this was a pretty good cd all the same.  Some of the songs sound basically the same but there are few that stand out.  Great guitar riff on song 5 The Edge of Paradise. Overall worth buying!

7,"I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella.  It isn't good.  It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent.  Each song is more insipid and boring than the last.  The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless.  Needless to say...I don't get it

8,"I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.
 
 Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.
 
 All of the tracks on here are solid. 
 
 For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.
 
 All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.
 
 All in all, BUY THIS CD

18,"This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film ""La Vallee"" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the ""dry"" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).
 
 Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus ""relieving"" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.
 
 Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.
 
 With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.
 
 All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).

19,"This is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics...
 
 The CD has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when I put the CD into my pc yet then I realised throughout every minute of the CD it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it, this is where the CD'S charm lies in it's bubble gum pop punk rock. It's fun, it's lighthearted it's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ If you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly, which is also nice they included the DVD with it so you can see the videos which show off the band's true vision.

20,"If you're a fan of either ""Holiday Inn"" or ""White Christmas"" you really, really should avoid this one.  Its recording quality not only offers substandard ""tin can"" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas.  
 
 This is not a soundtrack.  It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen.
 
 Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films.  The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... ""hate"" doesn't fit.  I am, however, not keeping this CD.  Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear.
 
 If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either.

23,"In 1962, it had been three years since Sonny Rollins had released a record.  Frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations, he took sabbatical to work on his form, practicing at the Williamsburg Bridge.  This odd habit led to his comeback album being named ""The Bridge"".  A quartet record featuring guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Ben Riley, invariably this album and it's story is the stuff of legends, and deservedly so.
 
 Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused (""Without a Song""), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of ""God Bless the Child"") and emotive (""Where Are You?"").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on ""God Bless the Child"", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.
 
 All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or ""Saxophone Collosus"") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.  Highly recommended

 The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting  to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring.

I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work.

It is a great, joyful rock album - I never even listened to the Dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre.  I've worked backstage at Stones, AC/DC and Dead shows, and I modestly suggest that I know the real thing when I hear it.  Tear the shrink wrap off, baby, and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down, while the weather is still warm enough to do so!

41,"If you are newer to Bach's abundent solo keyboard music - or Angela Hewitt - then this CD is an excellent place to start. It features the popular ""French Overture"" and contains some of the more lyrical and ""accessible"" music Bach wrote for the keyboard. There is a delightful mix of Bach compositions here capturing the diverse musical styles from Italy, France, Germany and Spain.  Bach shows himself to be a true ""non-politico"" as well as the master composer by skillfully combining these styles (namely from France and Italy) to produce works of great appeal and mastery - but in a style that is uniquely ""Bach.""
 
 In the opening piece, Hewitt does great justice to Bach's tribute to the Italian concerto style with a convincing ""dialog"" between lighter solo episodes (tutti) and the fuller passages imitating orchestral effect (ritornello) - all on one keyboar of course.  This piece is most famous for the Adagio which Hewitt infuses with much heart and soul by her delicate, thoughtful melodic lines that never approach over sentimentality.  The main event of this CD must certainly be the monumental ""French Overture"" (aka: Partita in B minor) - a grand conception lasting some 30 minutes repleat with numerous movements of French courtly dance influence and rich in imaginative and decorative keyboard effects.  Miss Hewitt wonderfully articulates these effervescent rhythms with supreme confidence and masterful result.  Her ornamentations are always tasteful, seamlessly integrated and truly enthralling to hear.  In the off-beat rhythms of the gigue, her semiquavers bounce off the page with great poise and the crispness of fresh-pressed linen.  And she shows her masterful pianism to its fullest in the curious final ""echo"" movement, bringing an brilliant, orchestral quality to it.
 
 Hiding in the shadows of these two main events are four charming little ""duets.""  These are no mere ""fillers"" but delightfully catchy, two-part inventions that Hewitt plays to full effect.  Rounding out the program is a most unique ""program music"" piece by Bach thought written around the story of his older brother's departure (""Capriccio on departure of his brother"").  In it, Angela Hewitt communicates both its nostalgic sentiments with her gentle, poinant phrasing and dynamics along with the piece's festive celebratory ending with her effective creation of trumpet and horn effects.  In this unique composition, Hewitt succeeds to create a wonderful range of emotive effects in one piece.
 
 Indeed, her carefree yet tight-on-the-rails style truly seems to bring out the best of Bach's keyboard treasures - transforming them into music of great vitality and charm.  Her approach to Bach is one of artistry, nuance and good taste (not unlike Schiff) but without the ""directness"" or the ""rough edges"" that can be found in other performer's approaches (Gould and Gulda, respectfully).  The many great Bach performers through the last decades have given us many ""pallates of color"" to experience, and Hewitt's colors are most notably beauty of tone, a poetic flavor, and graceful fluidity of line at its heart.  It is no wonder that Angela Hewitt has been heralded as ""the premier Bach pianist of this generation."" Just about any recording of Bach's keyboard music by Angela Hewitt is a safe bet for being among the top choices available, and this CD is certainly no exception.  It received the highest marks from both Gramaphone and Penguin Guides while ClassicsToday gave it a perfect 10/10 for Artisty/Sound Quality.  In all her Bach recordings from Hyperion, the sound quality of this recording is among the fullest and most realistically recorded (where some other recordings like her Couperin, WTC or French Suites are done with a touch more ""spaciousness"" but still with clarity).  Also a highlight are the scholarly and detailed notes delineating the nuances of the various ""dance"" types that Bach encorporated into his compositions.  In all, an emmensely satisfying recording from a top Bach pianist of our time.  Highly recommended

 I don't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves. In a world that's pumping out cr@p music. It's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry isn't totaly going down the toilet.

 -Excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13

 -Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album. 
 I hope NIN will continue. We need to purchase albums like this to show Trent R. that we appreciate his work.
 PS. Keep a look out for the new TOOL CD out in a few days. I've heard it(don't ask) and it is their best ever! A must buy.

The caller gets on and says, ""Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc.  I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is...

49,"Bottom line: a very enjoyable album for ANYONE with an open mind.  Girlfriends, boyfriends, single people, married people, old, young, male, female.
 
 You probably already know (and like) at least 3 songs from this album: ""Every Morning"", ""Someday"", ""Falls Apart"".  So, you're already off to a great start.
 
 And, for those of you old-school Sugar Ray ROCK fans, there's plenty here for you.  Try ""Personal Space Invader"", ""Aim For Me"", ""Glory"", and ""Burning Dog"" if you enjoy cranking it to 11.  Actually, this album is predominantly rock inspired...if you've  listened to the WHOLE THING.
 
 Hip hop fans will find ""Live and Direct"" featuring KRS-One to be a pleasant little surprise.
 
 80's fans will take to their spiced up rendition of Steve 
 Miller's ""Abracadabra"".
 
 And, they've got some nice softer tunes in the form of ""Ode to the Lonely Hearted"" and ""Even Though"" (a song which seems to have jumped off the time machine from the 50's or something...good stuff).
 
 And, of course there a bits and pieces of that trademark Sugar Ray humor thrown about the album.  Like they always say, Sugar Ray is all about having fun.  Period.  If things like ""image"" matter to you, then steer clear of this band.  If dogmatic adherence to one specific style of music (and ONLY one specific 
 style of music) excites you then steer clear of this band.
 
 But, if you like having fun with your music (a.k.a. ENJOYING it) and if you can appreciate diverse musical influences, then here ya' go

52,"Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track ""Cold"" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be ""Cold"", ""Starless"", ""Colors"", and ""Dead Skin"". Here's the track ratings...
 
 1. Starless - 9.5/10 
 2. Cold - 10/10 
 3. So Far Away - 9.5/10 
 4. Colors - 10/10 
 5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10  
 6. The Deep End - 9/10
 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10
 8. Dead Skin - 10/10
 9. Disco - 7/10 
 10. The Unknown - 9/10
 
 Overall: 93% A-
 
 Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection.

This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable.

SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better

58,"In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!  
 
       ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.  
 
       Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!  
 
      Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?  
 
       Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0) 
 
      The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.  
 
       Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't. 
 
       Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.  
 
       Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, ""All right I'll stay!""  
 
      In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?! 
 
       Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!  
 
      ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.  
 
       Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting.

59,"Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).
 
 But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.
 
 Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.
 
 But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound.

I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots.  I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay..  Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!

65,"Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days. 
 
 Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. 
 
 I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that ""hip-hop"" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45

76,"Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.
 
 I understand the necessity and the desire to ""update"" old hits from one's singing career to make them ""sing"" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.
 
 The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.
 
 If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Deja Vu"" period.
 
 But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements.

77,"I have no idea what people are thinking here. This is one of Wendy and Lisa's strongest albums aside from Eroica. Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.
  
  Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros. Waterfall was OK, but it has nothing on &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Bring You Back&quot;, or &quot;I've Got a Big Bowl of Cherries&quot;.
  
  And for the people complaining about Jonathan's death hanging too much over this album, this album was ALL ABOUT Jonathan's death! The whole reason they wrote the thing was part of their grieving process. The album is DEDICATED to him! Get a clue!
  
  To the reviewer ragging on the hidden track: That's deidcated to Trevor Horn, who screwed the girls over when he was producing (or more accurately, supposed to be producing) their album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing. 
  
  So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones. Tchad Blake did a great job on production, and the track lineup is varied and engaging. Every song has great depth and excellent melody

Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.  If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album

80,"All I have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads.  It really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are.
 
 Ballad--A ballad is a story, usually a narrative or poem, in a song. Any story form may be told as a ballad, such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form. It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.
 
 If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.
 
 Some good examples of ballads:
 The Devil Went Down to Georgia,
 The Ballad of Jesse James,
 Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier,
 Ode to Billie Joe
 
 While there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not.  The same goes with that Monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock

83,"Being a fan of The Divine Comedy since they released Casanova in 1996, I was really looking forward to their latest album. Much like a lot of previous releases by The DC, this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it. When I first listened to it, I was disappointed with most of the early tracks and didn't listen beyond track 7. However, repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection. Track-by-track:
 
 1. To Die A Virgin - Amusing lyrics, but the melody doesn't do anything for me. Opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here, this being no exception. It sounds a bit flat to me.
 
 2. Mother Dear - An unusual country track with a catchy melody, but a far too repetitive chorus. Musically it's great, but the constant repetition of ""Mother Dear"" quickly becomes tiresome.
 
 3. Diva Lady - Not bad, but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by Neil Hannon. Annoyingly it sticks in your head - I'd rather it didn't!
 
 4. A Lady Of A Certain Age - Beautiful melodies, wonderful instrumentation, and moving lyrics. I've always liked Hannon's voice, but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to. Stunning.
 
 5. The Light Of Day - A bright, upbeat melody, again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the DC have always done so well.
 
 6. Threesome - A charming 1 minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album.
 
 7. Party Fears Two - Elsewhere I've hear people calling The Plough pompous; if any track sounds pompous, it is this one. I haven't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that isn't all that special. The chorus is better than the verse, but this just sounds out of place here.
 
 8. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World - This one's quite odd. I didn't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you. Great lyrics, a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies. Very well composed indeed.
 
 9. The Plough - As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous. It's an absolute masterpiece. A wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track. A similar feel to The Certainty of Chance or Freedom Road, this is one of the best tracks I have ever heard from the DC.
 
 10. Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont - The opening melody links well from The Plough. Great melodies throughout, an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics, not dissimilar to The Booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over. Very special, and unique!
 
 11. Snowball In Negative - Yet again, the orchestral arrangements are superb. Interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos, showing that Threesome wasn't such an anomaly after all. The ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out, but this track wraps up the album well.
 
 Apart from the first few tracks, this is possibly the best DC album I've ever heard. It's right up there with Promenade and Fin De Siecle and is a welcome reminder that Hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon. Beautiful

If you need a nostalgia fix for the Beach Boys' best albums of the Sixties through the mid-Seventies, pick up the two-fers of their classic albums from SURFIN' SAFARI through SURF'S UP. However, if you want a solid overview of America's most influential band and why Brian Wilson is regarded as a genius, wrap your ears around this 5-disc GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. Brian Wilson and company take you on a  magical history tour from their debut single ""Surfin'"" to their final No. 1, ""Kokomo."" ESSENTIA

85,"I was not feeling this album at all which is strange because I like Mac Dre and Dubee quite a bit.  I was not feeling the tracks.  It was too funk oriented, with some dumb sounding tracks.  It was not the smooth type of production that I expected to hear coming out of Vallejo.  A big disappointment

86,"Joe Cocker teams up with Tulsa native Leon Russell and a cast of over forty for a concert tour, and what a party! The live set contains a mix of Russell compositions and blues/R&amp;B/pop/rock standards, all performed with the feral intensity of a man possessed. It's clear that the magic couldn't last in this form, and it didn't, although Cocker did go on to make many fine records, and even some great ones, after his jaunt with Russell

87,"My wife and I just returned from the John Jorgenson concert in Jonesborough, TN.  We agreed that neither of us expects to ever hear a finer guitarist!  We bought two of his CDs during intermission (including Franco-American Swing).  As much as we will enjoy listening to them for years to come, nothing will replace the rare privilege of ""seeing"" this master play.  The experience can't be described with words.  The audience even gave him a standing ovation at the intermission of his two set show!  And two more before the end of the evening's concert.
 Buy this CD ... you aren't likely to regret it.  And check out his web site www.johnjorgenson.com to see if he is playing anywhere near you.  It will be worth the drive to catch his show.

89,"i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star

91,"Now usually if I know 100% that something is wack, I won't waste my money on it and can just download it for free. Now I wish that I didn't even do that at all. A lot of reviewers seem to have faced the facts: Paris CANNOT SING! This here has proven that clearly. Now that I think about it, what can she do?...other than being a rich [female] who keep her name in the news (That ""E!"" channel if anyone actually watches that) on something stupid. Now on to this. There is no other explaimation to it except that it sucks. The original song sucks, and the four remixes are even worse, not to mention that some of them are pretty long in length. But lets face the facts; despite many 1 or 2 star reviews, bull [...] music is going to sell. True, if the rap group Dead 4 Life can have a high selling single ""Laffy Taffy"" and have their album go gold, there is no telling for what numbers Paris Hilton will put up, just because it's her. Easily one of the worst songs I've heard in the past 5 years.
 
 
 Take my advice: There is halfassed talent out there that is better than this. Also $18 is too much to have something to sit your drinks on. And if this is imported, it should have been confiscated when trying to get through U.S. customs. It's THAT bad!
 
 When songs like this see the light of day, you know that shes doing whatever she can to stay relevant.

94,"Lisa Gerrard's music moves me in ways that no other singer/musician does. Being a DCD fan, I bought Mirror Pool & Duality the day they were released. (They are still my favories)
  The Insider is a great movie. Some of the best work I have seen from Crowe & Pacino. Lisa captures the mood (much like she did with Gladiator) with her special unique voice & style.
  Lisa's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if I am going through a re-birthing. The sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come. The struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace. Meltdown at the end of this score fits perfectly. I love to meditate to Lisa's music and let her take me on a beautiful journey. Art at its finest

95,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.
 
 I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.
 
 Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.
 
 My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help

98,"What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word ""pathetic"", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, ""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like ""Fire Water Burn"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Hell Yeah"", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits.
 About the ""music"": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do ""best"", and don't try metal. ""Magna Cum Nada"" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop.
 The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.
 
 Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?
 
 1. I Hope You Die: See track 15
 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great.
 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15
 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15
 5. Mope: See track 15
 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15
 
 Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. ""1 star , because 0 is not an option"" is exactly correct.
 
 People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.
 
 p.s. Track 15 is called ""This is Stupid.

99,"NOTE: I bought this CD a while ago, the tunes were mediocre. Then again I'm probably biased because I don't really like rap a whole lot. 
 
 Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask?
 
 The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you. 
 
 
 In ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality. 
 
 Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with ""foul language"". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree. 
 
 He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap. 
 
 
 The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music.
 
 
 SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (a genre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that. 
 
 Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you. But if it dosn't, then ignore this review....or ignore it because you don't like my opinion.
