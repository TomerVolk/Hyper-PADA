0,"I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start. 
 
 I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad. 
 
 I really couldn't recommend this book any less

1,"This is one book on ancient Israel that actually delivers what its title promises. In &quot;The Early History of God&quot; Mark Smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from Bronze and Iron Age Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for YHWH, his cult, and his context. Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating. The long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago, and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion. This is the kind of book that helps keep scholarship in good repute. Don't wait to read it

2,"I thought this book was terrible.  I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's).  Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor.  I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, ""She writes like she learned to write from watching TV.""  The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me.  There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke.  You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system?  Go read Grisham

3,"*disclaimer: I am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what I am addressing.*  
 
 I do not mean to say that Bennett and Hacker have all the answers, but their ""ordinary language"" approach, along with their debt to Wittgenstein, Ryle, Kenny and Strawson, says something about their book.  Most contemporary philosophers of mind (Sprague, Strawson and Hacker, among others, excluded) have rightly dismissed the soul, but have decided that there is something ""mysterious"" about consciousness, or perception or emotion, or what have you.  In response, Bennett and Hacker have shown what ""consciousness"" really is: the conscious acts of people existing in the world.  This is why we know that other people are conscious actors: they do conscious things such as watch birds, or play chess, or eat ham sandwiches.  
 
 If Michael Tye's or David Chalmers' or Colin McGinn's problems of consiousness (e.g. that I can know that you feel the same pain that I feel, or that you see the same color that I see) are indeed problems for you, you should read this book; if it doesn't prove to you that they are not problems at all, at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions

This is especially significant when it comes to XML because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away.  This book does exactly that.  You will start writing decent xml right away.  
 
 The following will be helpful.
 
 1.  HTML knowledge (a little)
 2. The concept of scripts
 3.  The concept of CSS
 4. The concept of XML 
 
 When I say 'the concept of', I am only talking about a surface level, ""Purpose of existence"" kind.  Even if you don't know anything about XML, you will be fine with this book.
 
 The book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas.

5,"I usually do not put aside a book before finishing it.  In this case, I got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail.  I purchased this book hoping (despite prior reviews) that it was more food lit than self analysis.  However, the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships, and indeed not in its descriptions of food in Desalvo's life.  If you are interested in it anyway, good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it

6,"While this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of &quot;all too common&quot; web mistakes, I have to disagree with the author's conclusions in many cases. In particular, he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible, responsible for poorly written content, lackluster site maintenance and other &quot;bloopers&quot; as he calls them. Fact is, most web developers would love to spend the time &quot;investing&quot; in doing a thorough job. However, in many cases, the client often doesn't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job. While there is enough blame to go around in poor web design, it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes. I also take exception to his commentary at times, in specific, his early mention of Enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company. He points to a bold claim Enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature. While Enron may have troubles, it's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers. We can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point. Lastly, I found the layout to be a little difficult to read. Often, the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about. The book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book. These are only a few points in a long list of what's wrong with this book. While the author makes some valid points, I found this book a little too much to stomach. Read at your own peril

8,"`The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons.
 
 So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors.
 
 It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows.
 
 These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy.
 
 By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals.
 
 Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as www.foodtv.com, but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com. This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars.
 
 Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment.

11,"So not only is this a great play by Shakespeare but it's also an easy version to read right along side the original text. No need to get out the old dictionary for those words that you stumble across trying to guess the actual meaning of because it's right there next to you. This doesn't take away from the play at all either. Speaking of the play, this is a wonderful romance that reminds us how naive people can be if they aren't exposed to all of the harsh realities of life. The lady in this play practically falls in love with the first man she lays eyes on that she hasn't grown up with! It may have something to do with the magic that her father possesses. Better yet, it has everything to do with her father and the spirits that are under his spell. After you're done with the book, try to find a live performance of this play

God was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin.

14,"When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.
 
 Boy, was I wrong.
 
 In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.
 
 The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.
 
 Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.
 
 Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion

17,"I haven't read anything by Flannery O'Connor since ""All Things That Rise Must Converge."" I fell in love with her stories. There is so much life in them. I read this work to get an idea about her ""sitz im leben"", her life-situation, her milieu. A lot of it is correspondence, and there are some presentations as well. I am wondering if it speaks to the modern would-be novelist as much as it spoke to writers of her time and place. She says that one needs to write out of the context of where you are: the place, the people, the geography. This is mandatory, not optional. 
 
 This book is for writers. I appreciate her writing about how to be Catholic in the South, a very small minority. She has contributed much to finding faith in the stories of life, even violent and brutal stories. I look forward to my next work of hers

The description lets argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that is hard to believe. It uses SOAP in it's more basic fashion.

21,"First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians. 
 
 This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book.  The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages.
 
 The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored. 
 
 I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages  carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected

23,"I couldn't resist the title, so I got this book. Unfortunately, I cannot reccommend it to people who want to learn to write better Perl, execpt as a source of examples of the mistakes you should avoid.
 
 For example, in one of the earliest examples, the authors uses ""return undef"" in a situation where the return value of the routine is assigned to an array, to indicate the routine didn't find any of whatever it was looking for. Unfortunately, this is a mistake, the correct code would be to use ""return;"" all on its own. The correct solution produces an empty array or interim values; the mistake creates an array containing one element, 'undef'.
 
 There are a number of similar mistakes which indicate the author is in over his head, writing things he doesn't understand; the editors know even less about the matter; and the code was never tested and verified for correctness.
 
 If you want to learn Perl, get ""Learning Perl""; If you want to improve your Perl, get ""Intermediate Perl.

25,"I had originally seen this book as a subject of PBS' Frontline several months ago. I was enthralled by the subject matter and decided to get a copy from the local library and read about it myself. What a mistake. The PBS Frontline TV program was so much better than the book. I found Maraniss'  switch from the Viet Nam story to the University of Wisconsin protest story very aggravating; and, as another reader mention, it made for a very disjointed narrative. The juxtapositioning of the two narratives does not work!
 
 I found myself more interested in the war portion of the book than reading about Soglin and his friends embroiled in a protest against Dow Chemical. Frankly, I found this portion of the book to be quite a bore and it almost ruined the book for me. Who cares about college kids and their protesting episodes. It is simply not important. 
 
 If you are interested in reading the book, read the Nam portion and skip the protest chapters. Better yet, catch the Frontline episode and skip the book completely.

The voices are what I imagined them to be, maybe better. If only one person was narrorating this book (like most are done now) then this book probably wouldn't be as much fun to listen to on CD.

29,"This book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth.  As some readers have complained, this is not really a ""Christian"" book because the focus isn't on Christ, it's on YOU.  
 
 A Biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally, the way Jesus would, and not on trying to ""find the perfect spouse.""  The whole premise of the book is rather un-Christlike:  making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you.  It's rather selfish, really, when you consider the words of John the Baptist: ""Christ must become more, I must become less,"" as well as the warning in Song of Solomon ""Do not awaken love until it so desires.""  
 
 Shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify Christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires?  Finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines.  Hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic, Christlike love must take precedence.  I don't mean to sound accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls ""seduction.""
 
 My brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a ""poser."" This happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex.  You have to ask:  What kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are?  I personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality.

31,"I wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun.  Instead, I found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people.  Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's &quot;fiesty, independent and outspoken&quot;, she is repeatedly referred to as &quot;difficult to HANDLE&quot; and &quot;a real handful&quot;.  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be &quot;handled&quot;?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really &quot;met her match&quot; in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his &quot;faults&quot; to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY

32,"I read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security. It does not. In fact, it glosses over the key, overriding issue: that the so-called ""social security trust fund"" does not in fact exist. The claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an IOU that the government writes to itself. 
 
 The book spends all of one paragraph (see page 28) on this critical issue, suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds, rather than government bonds, and concluding, ""It is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund's portfolio should make any difference.""

 Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in ""good"" and ""evil"" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.

39,"I can use ""picture book"" to describe Full Moon, as images contributed as the major part of this book. Don't think that this book is not worth reading, indeed, it is on the contrary, this is an extraordinary book, because of the photos.
 
 There are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos, but when you read them, you would find the images are not so good at all, but not because of the photo itself, because of the low resolution. And if you are familiarize with those photos, you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution. It is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution.
 
 However, when you first look into Full Moon, you will find you're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the Moon taken from Apollo Mission. Normally, owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s, all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution. However, Project Full Moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images. I can even tell you that, NASA even don't have such high resolution images before.

40,"Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years. 
 
 I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.
 
 I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers

Jacobs loved the city that she saw from her Hudson and eleventh street apartment New York City apartment. This was not the city that the master planners Burnham, Mumford etc idolized. Her city was small stores, and businesses, and the greatest possible diversity of buildings and architectural styles. People doing all kinds of different things. Life on the move. Density and diversity. Short blocks and lots of people out walking on different destinations.

43,"I've read this book a few times, and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories, wicked satire, and twisted plots.  Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea (as other reviews have shown) but I loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting (a la Wilkie Collins or Palliser's own Quincunx) and send-ups of modern literary theory, in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader, and such luminaries as Jeffery Archer, seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist.  I am not a fan of books as puzzles, but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction;  it's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection

44,"... This is a very good read ... this book offers much more than the usual approach of `tell the dog to sit, and reward it with a treat' ... the author approaches the problem of bad dog behaviour from the owner's perspective, as well as from the dog's perspective ... a holistic approach that avoids harsh punishment ... The author tells us that in order to correct a dog, oftentimes we must first as owners correct ourselves, our approach ... our whole attitude ... we are encouraged to try and learn the nature of dogs, their instincts and propensities ... the numerous case studies are also extremely useful ... All in all, a very good book, informative, sensible and effective

47,"With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers.  As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective.  Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10).  As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan.  Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media.  Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world.  As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable.  I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.

48,"I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what ""the Rabbit"" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently. 
 The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.  The only reason I did not fall asleep, was that I was trying to figure out what was going on, but I did could not  even finish this book

49,"Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it.  I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website.  First of all, a little background.  I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks.  I adore him.  I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago.  I now work 5 days a week outside the house.  I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work.  My response was that I am &quot;selfish&quot; and unfit to have a dog.  This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep.  I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested.    But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him.  Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally.  She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners.  It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them.  Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry!  Not interested!  Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion

50,"I am thrilled with this book. It is clear, concise, and thorough. I'm totally excited to make all the slopers to begin creating my own library of designs. Content-wise the only drawbacks is that it's mostly based on standard form sizes. They do give directions about how to measure the body and the drafting itself is pretty simply explained so either measurements can be used. Also, there aren't instructions about collars or cuffs or button/zipper extensions which, granted, are not really necessarily drafted by measurements. But you do need a supplemental Flat pattern making book for those items.
 
 The only real cons I can tell are the publisher's fault - not the author's. The book is rather skinny for the price - I too was expecting a monster text. Should have known better - its a textbook right? so of course they gouge the student. Shameless really. On top of it, it is rather cheaply done - the pages look like photocopies!
 
 Also, one reviewer mentioned that it came with the neckline tool - I didn't get one! Now I have to scour the internet to find a replacement because they don't have directions about how to draft a neckline. My only real annoyance.

51,"Donna Jo Napoli's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in ""The Magic Circle,"" her retelling of ""Hansel and Gretel"". Napoli's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales, reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable. Such is certainly the case in ""The Magic Circle"", in which she explores the background of Hansel and Gretel's wicked witch.
 
 The hunchback woman is known as the Ugly One by all her neighbours, but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval Europe community. She is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called Asa, and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage. But her friend Bala has other ideas, getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that Ugly One may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to Bala of course. 
 
 Ugly One is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms, knowing the danger is extremely great, but as a devout Christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with Bala's wishes - surely God will aid her, and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons' tricks. After cleansing a little boy from a demon's influence, Ugly One knows that she has found her new calling in life.
 
 But once several years pass, her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever, she is careless with the protective magic circle. What follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers. Bartering with the demons for her daughter's life, Ugly One manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest.
 
 In Napoli's book the term `witch' is used in the traditional Christian sense, not the New Age one, so be prepared for a negative usage of the word (personally I found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days!) However, it's not so black and white, for though Ugly One can no longer shed tears, bleed or sleep, has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children, she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses. Living in isolation, she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home...
 
 Napoli's story is poignant and thought-provoking, as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil, the will of God and the strength of the individual against temptation. Like all her other books, her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of ""Hansel and Gretel"" forever. Although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning Bala is raised only to be ignored, ""The Magic Circle"" is an intriguing little book. The demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real Biblical and Occult study (so you'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale!) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day. Though it is not my favourite Napoli novel (that would have to be ""Zel"" and ""Spinners""), ""The Magic Circle"" is a great little read.

52,"Returning more fully to the Reformation theology theme of the first volume (&quot;The Antichrist 666&quot;), which theme indeed undergirds the entire series, author and researcher Wil Sutton examines what the Bible has to say about &quot;The Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet&quot; the Devil's  counterfeit trinity at the end of time. He examines all forms of paganism/  spiritualism, Satan's original religion from Eden until now (the Dragon),  Roman Catholicism (the Beast), and apostate Protestantism (the False  Prophet). Sutton shows how these three forces are working together to  effect the downfall of humanity today, in the years immediately preceeding  the Second Coming of Christ. Too strong a comment? You NEED this book!  Things are NOT what they seem; what often seems good to human beings ISN'T!  The streams of the previous four volumes meet and end in this one. Bible  prophecy will finally make real sense to you. You will learn what is right  ahead of us in time, and what YOU need to do to get ready: something you  owe it to yourself and your family to learn. Read this one with your 'King  Jimmy' open!

53,"Henry Morris is neither a scientist nor a theologian. He's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who's obsessively promoted the 7th Day Adventist doctrine of a ""young earth creation"" far outside the SDA denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches. He's since gone on to promote the ""King James Only"" cult group which further seeks to spread 7th Day Adventist false doctrines among Baptist Fundamentalists, and even promoted a sort of astrology among Christians! Jesus said we'll know them by their fruits - Morris' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the Earth, and seekers convinced that the Bible isn't true because of Morris' bizarre interpretation of Genesis. Morris deserves nothing but a firm, unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the Bible, slandering other Christians ...and lying about science

60,"There is no doubt that Sun Tzu's little book on war is an enduring classic, but this little edition is ridiculous.  There is a reason it is so cheap.  It is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.  If you are going to take the trouble to buy and read Sun Tzu's masterpiece, you should at least get a version that explains what Sun Tzu was really talking about.
 
 The best translation is by Giles, as is this, but in the original Giles translation there is a running commentary, between the lines by Giles and several classical Chinese scholars, explaining both the context and meaning of the text.  It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides.
 
 There are several editions of the full Giles edition available.  Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version.  The best is the Special Edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version, like this edition, in addition to the Chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for

61,"I recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when I sat down to read it. The subtitle is &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles to Stimulate Your Creativity &amp; Imagination&quot;. Actually, there are only some  thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts'. However, my  biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy. The very first puzzle (p. 20)  has a mistake in it. Then in 'Mental Counting' (p. 161), the author claims  that the letters O and U are not symmetrical about the vertical axis. As  for 'Three-dimesional Dots' (p. 199) the text states &quot;Below is a  collection of random dots.&quot; Unfortunately, the random dots have been  omitted. So much for &quot;something remarkable&quot; happening as the  author claims. And how's this for one of the three (yup, only three)  lateral thinking puzzles? What common word begins with IS, ends with ND,  and has LA in the middle? I bet that really stretched your brain, didn't  it? Sorry, but Mr. Wujec's editor should be fired.

The Ugly American had a tremendous influence on American foreign policy back then.  It highlighted our arrogance and our vulnerabilities when we forget the importance of understanding other cultures.  And President Kennedy practically made it mandatory reading for his advisors.
 
 What was most interesting to me, however, was how pertinent the book is today.  Instead of Sarkhan or Vietnam, the book could be about Iraq.  Regardless of your feelings about the war, the Ugly American is enlightening and should remind us how important it is to understand others when we occupy their nation.  The book is a short -- but important -- read.  I recommend it to everyone.  It is a classic not so much because of its language or story.

73,"Giordano is a pro from way back in the day... he hasn't been able to adjust to the changing styles and this art book is a sad display of that fact. I recommend getting a straight art instruction book from Bridgman, Hogarth, or Loomis. This book shows his deplorable lack of anatomy knowledge (seemed to be mainstay back in the 50's a la Ditko & Kirby anatomy), his simplistic 3D construction, and overdrawn oval shaped good girls, etc. He also graduated from the Wally Wood school of art where if you didn't know how to render anatomy you blacked it out. Still, he was one of the prime lenders to the modern comic language, so I suppose this is some publisher's way of patting him on the head and saying thanks for the memories.
 
 Don't expect to come away with any newer material already covered in ""How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way"" by Stan Lee and Buscema (very simplistic book but the comic dynamics are much better) or any new sensitivity to modern storytelling. This book CAN NOT prepare you for any MODERN styles. Ranks slightly better than a Christopher Hart book (need I say more...?)

I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic???  The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).

84,"The only reason Pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in  nations such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia and parts of Africa. Firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the Quran in a coherent fashion.
 
 People ""claim"" that he is very much true to the Arabic of the Quran; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context. Well that is the point how can it be a ""literal"" translation when it is infact out of context in most places.
 
 There is also an issue of a history with this translation, it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator (Pickthall) but other individuals.
 
 Most Quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error. That is the problem, most readers who rely on the English (first hand) may not even know if there are errors.
 
 Not only is this translation subjective, nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the Quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is NOT substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he; (or now in the case of so many revisions, as ""they"") did.

90,"In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis. 
 
 Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing ""inductivism"" by ""deductivism."" In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results. 
 
 But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier. 
 
 The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.
 
 Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.
 
 Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used.

91,"I had rated this book a ""two"" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one. 
 
 I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:
 
 In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.
 
 Love is worth fighting and dieing for.
 
 Love is stronger than evil.
 
 What does not kill you, makes you stronger.
 
 Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.
 
 The key to happiness is love, not material gain. 
 
 Evil lurks where you least expect it

He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't.

I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it.

Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.

98,"Three facts about economists teaching laypeople:
 
 1: Economists love to be counter-intuitive.
 2: Economists love to be controversial.
 3: Economists love to go on about their personal opinions as though they were fact because, after the above two points, no one feels he or she can defend any contradicting opinion
 
 This book suffers from the worst of these points. Yes, economics is sometimes quite the opposite of what one might think and is very often ""politically inviable"" because of its conclusions, but Mr. Landsburg goes far too much into the rhelm of ""I'm the author, you have to do what I say."" I, too, agree that, for example, enviromental policies are often extremely ineffecient. However, if these policies are important to others, if they bring happiness or, in other words, ""utility"" to a degree greater than the opportunity costs incured, that's their business. The book is scattered with his belittlement of the poor idiots who don't understand economics and if they did they would think like him. 
 
 This is the sort of reason why people don't like econmists. This is why people think we're heartless prigs. If the people through whom this book must have gone before it was published knew enough about economics to defend their positions instead of just accepting the author as their better, they would have perhaps reminded him to tone down some of his particulars that he forms into generalities.
 
 
 To summize: Mr. Landsburg is an insufferable know-it-all, who does, in all fairness, know-it-some

101,"I dislike writing negative reviews but I'll make another exception here. My wife showed me this book one lazy Saturday afternoon in a local bookstore. ""I want you to look at this. It was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly.""
 
 This book should have developed real conjecture on the emotional lives of farm animals. It could have been a serious discussion of what we understand about animal emotions both positive and negative. It would have demonstrated how the natural farming movement has the potential to revolutionize animal husbandry and improve farm animal living conditions. Should have, could have, would have ... it didn't.
 
 He apparantly intuits emotions from these creatures who at the very least do not speak his language and at the most are experiencing very different emotions than the ones he describes. Doubtless he is gifted with superhuman intuitive ability from his years of analytic training; us mere mortals would be unable to consistantly reproduce his observations.
 
 (As a brief example look at the emphasis on eye expressions despite a lack of evidence for any real facial expression translatability across species lines. Urban readers cannot readily observe farm animals to verify this so I'd suggest a trip to the local zoo to test my counter assertion. There, the most casual observer can see that a broad, friendly human smile will send an entire cagefull of monkeys into conniptions. Why? Because many species of simians translate 'smile' as 'teeth-baring dominence display'.)
 
 Nevertheless I rated this book 2 stars instead of one, as there were a few interesting anectdotes interspersed amongst the verbage.
 
 (Edited to add a note about trembling cows.) Cows tremble when they are annoyed by flies. Having no hands their first line of defence is their tail, but flies often land on shoulders and other body parts out of its limited reach. They tremble, shaking their skin to dislodge the pests. They shake their heads, sometimes violently. Their eyes roll and they sometimes look like they're going to fall over. I suppose it is convenient for the writer of this book that flies congregate where cows are penned together but more so that people have forgotten the 2000 year old story of Io, Hera and Zeus.

103,"If a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that Adams makes about Thomas Eakins, one would think that the artist was homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, and a pedophile, exhibitionist, voyeur, sadist, and masochist; and further, that he practiced incest and bestiality (all of which, Adams suggests, was driven by a desire to posses his own mother).  Take your pick!  Adams covers all the bases. Eakins is not so much ""revealed"" in this book as he is ""concealed.""  He seems to ignore altogether, what to my mind, are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man: that he studied logarithms for fun, that science, not art, was his first love, that he was conversant in five languages, and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness.  Among the more humorous assertions that Adams makes about Eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor (he used an easel), that he shot his sister's cat for fun (Adams conveniently leaves out the fact that Eakins' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid), and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses, which supposedly reminded Eakins of outfits his dead mother wore.  After reading this dreadful book I came to actually like it as a study of how inbred (dare I say incestuous?) that some members of our academic community have become.  Even if you are convinced, or want to believe that Abraham Lincoln was homosexual, you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously

106,"This is now the third of Levenda's books I have read and the second in this particular series.  As other reviewers have noted, by the end of this edition, the author's leftist political views and anti-Catholic epistemological perspective overwhelm the narrative to the point that credibility suffers.  This is really rather sad, as Levenda is a talented writer, who has done, evidently, some significant research.  Unfortunately, it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the Bush clan, whilst holding the hideous Clintons above reproach, and worse, misses no opportunity to villify the Church, while smiling at Wicca.  The hypocricy is really breathtaking.
 
 Understand that, in the corpus of this text, there is much that is worthwhile, certainly entertaining, and well presented.  It is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance.
 
 This volume ends, as did the last, not with a bang, but with a whimper.  In fact, Levenda's last paragraph is, in its entirety, a quote from ""The Book of Ceremonial Magic"", of all things.  We are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series.  There is much else that cries out to be read.  We may read the next in volume, if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored.  But this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience.

Espionage, after all, is the art of the possible. A knows something and B wants to find out A) what A knows and B) how he knows what it is. It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.
  
  And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so.

110,"Underworld is an ambitious book.   By examining politics, economics, and popular culture in the United States during the last half of the twentieth century, author Don DeLillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice.  In the world that he depicts, people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate.  In his opening scene, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game, where a young man senses ""the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations, the unseen something that haunts the day.""  In other passages of the book, these connections take the form of history or a system: ""that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you.""
 
 The book focuses on Nick Shay, a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the Bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant.  It takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation, and this results in a pretty long book: 827 pages in the hard cover edition.  DeLillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in Nick's personal transformation, so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry, environmental degradation, and J. Edgar Hoover.  
 
 The connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious, and I would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm.  Also, DeLillo's dialogue has a definite style:  his characters seem to hoard their words, and an awful lot of them don't finish their sentences.  Whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader's tastes.  For me, this is a much better book than DeLillo's White Noise and Libra, which have been widely praised.

115,"Let me start by explaining the title of my review: being an Indian (settled in India, not outside) I am incessantly perplexed by the plethora or completely rubbish books from India which the West just can't seem to get enough of. Books which say nothing about India, and are not about it. Just books set in India, which throw in some curry and some local language, and somehow thus make people fall all over themselves in an attempt to praise the book. My gut revolts against such partisanship, and this is one of those books which is a perfect example of this rubbish trend, and hence is going to get such deserving treatment at my hands.
 
 But let me start by going back a bit in time and giving credit where it's due: after reading his first two books, I came to the very early conclusion that Vikram Chandra was the narrator's Narrator, a storyteller of uncommon brilliance, a weaver of magic tales. On the flip side, like most other Chandra fans, I too was frustrated by his ability to end every one of his stories in the worst all of all possible ways; but I loved his craft nonetheless. I had almost convinced myself that with his next book, I'd stop about 10% before the end of the book, and with Sacred Games, that promise turned out to be very easy to fulfill - I managed to put the book down without dying of guilt about halfway through itself.
 
 Sacred Games is a book about nothing: there are no characters who feel real, it is not about the protagonists' environment, it doesn't rotate around or shed new light on any events, and it doesn't deal with any objects of fascination. Nothing. Nil. Zilch. Nada. A lot of people have talked about this as another of the, if not the definitive Bombay book, but having lived there myself, I can vouch for the fact that this book doesn't even begin to capture an iota of the character or the essence of Bombay. (If you really want to read about the city, read ""Shantaram"" - now that's a book!) In fact, I think one of the lowest points of the book is how it fails to create any context - the events of this book could almost have happened anywhere, at almost any point in time. (And no, that does not make it timeless - just outright insipid.) Simple mechanisms like linkages to some real-life events would have given the reader something to hold on to - but no, Mr. Chandra refuses to give any straws to the drowning. Reviewers have gone ga-ga over it's portrayal of the Bombay Mafia, but there is nothing said here which is even remotely new, and there isn't the slightest different twist to it. Dons, corrupt policemen, actors, dancing girls, slums, and smuggling - everything has been told, and told much better. 
 
 A stunningly stupid highlight of this book is the copious usage of local language without any glossary to help the readers understand what the terms mean. I have almost been a local there, and though I understood most of the local or slang language, there were terms which bewildered even me. I understand that Mr. Chandra believes that this deliberate omission of explanations draws you into the story, but when there are 10 or more such words per page, it will leave a lot of readers more irritated than intrigued.
 
 Overall, I would strongly recommend avoiding this book. The Indians because there is nothing here that you don't know or can't read about in a better written book, and the rest because this is not about India -it's just a forced nowhere story. Save your money and your time. Go buy or read something else.

What I admire most about Ms Goodman is her persistence - while there are other hard-working investigative journalists - Seymour Hersh, Robert Fisk, to name a few - no one - but no one - punches in as many hours on the clock as she does.  All of which is evidenced in the book which is a summation of the highlights of her research leading up to the build-up of the war in Iraq and through the war as it stands now.

120,"The story starts with an introduction to a somewhat cantankerous, yet highly amusing character, Gen. He is stuck in jail, having been caught thieving. He bragged about the theft, which is what got him caught. 
 
 He is taken from prison and told that the King wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth. Gen's only other option is death. So onward the journey goes. He travels with the Magus and his two apprentices, Ambiades and Sophos, plus the admirable soldier, Pol.
 
 Gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft. This viewpoint lends a somewhat snide, yet funny and endearing perspective of the story. I enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout.
 
 Plus, on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their Gods through campfire stories, which I found a wonderful addition to the story. They added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did.

121,"I would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" is just a rehash of ""Elegant Universe"" with little more to offer, and in fact not as well written.  On the contrary, I found ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" to be equally as engaging as ""Elegant Universe"" and to offer a great deal of new material.  It is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books, but I for one preferred it that way.  I read ""Elegant Universe"" several years ago, and although I have a general feel for the concepts, I appreciated the refresher on many of the details.  By including the background material in ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" I never felt lost, and I never had to refer back to another book.  The background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books, but it is not identical, so I never felt like I was rereading the same old stuff.
 
 Another minor issue I've seen some complain about is the use of The Simpson's (and other) television characters in his examples.  Personally I could care less what characters are used in the examples, but from a practical standpoint, I much preferred names like Marge and Lisa to names like Slim and Jim (which were used in ""Elegant Universe"").  I could easily keep track of what Marge and Lisa were doing in an example, whereas I was often confused about what Slim and Jim were doing.  The similar sounding names drove me crazy.  So from a practical standpoint, I preferred the names used in ""Fabric of the Cosmos"".
 
 Now what about the content of the two books?  For me ""Elegant Universe"" was more of an introduction to string theory, whereas  ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" was much more an exposition on cosmology.  In ""Elegant Universe"" roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics, and then the remainder of the book, some 250 pages, was about string theory.  In ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics, (about 120 pages) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of ""what is space"" and ""what is time"".  Then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe.  If you want an excellent description of inflation theory, Higgs fields, and the like, this is the source.  And then only in the last roughly 120 pages does Greene bring string theory into all of this, and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book.  Bottom line is ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that I did not get from ""Elegant Universe"".  Both books are outstanding, and I would certainly recommend both.  The point being simply that these are different books, and ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" is not just a rehash of ""Elegant Universe"".
 
 Finally, as in ""Elegant Universe"", Greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next.  I've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived.  In Greene's book this is never an issue.  Sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense, but I would much prefer a book that I can logically work my way through, albeit sometimes with a bit of patience, than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve.  Don't get me wrong though, even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense, I never found it to be dry.  Greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout.
 
 Very highly recommended

This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1)  The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames.

127,"Many years after his more famous work, the Zen master is still very, very, good. In Lila he continues to explore his new metaphysics of value, morals, and quality. Although he definitely stretches in places, there is some very solid work attempting to create a more accurate way of describing the universe and our place in it. It ties very solidly with the modern understanding of quantum physics, and fits with absolute perfection the philosophies of the seminal work ""The Structure of Scientific Revolution"" by Thomas S. Kuhn. This novel is more straight philosophy than Motorcycle Maintenance, less balanced with an interwoven plot. The plot is there though, and it gives us an even more immediate sense of the author's own precarious mental balance. Many critics call the story bleak and depressing, which may be accurate, but is about as salient as calling Moby Dick a fishing story

128,"Satirical.  Sarcastic.  Ironic.  Humorous.  Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life.  This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets

130,"I am in the infant stages of my conversion to Judaism, and this book really cemented my conviction that this is the right decision for me.  I felt that Rabbi Kushner clearly explained what Judaism is all about to him and, in many instances, to me as well.  The chapter dealing with the dietary laws I found particularly helpful and enlightening, as this is one of the most intimidating factors for me in converting to Judaism and living as an observant Jew.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations helped me understand the dietary laws in a different way, as allowing the sacred to enter into mealtimes -- which takes the focus off food -- and I immediately began ""keeping kosher"" to an extent.  
 
 I didn't feel that this book slammed Christianity, but I'm not a Christian so my perspective is decidedly one-sided.  I did feel that this is a book about Judaism, not about Christianity.  There are places where Rabbi Kushner compares and contrasts the two religions, but I didn't get the sense that he was saying, ""Our way is better than your way.""  I DID get the sense that he is a man who feels deeply connected to God, and sees his religion as the source of that connection.  While it's likely that a (relatively) small number Christians would read this book, it seems to be intended for Jews -- a book for Jews about Judaism, written by a Jew.  The references to Christianity did not seem to be an instruction guide on Christianity so much as a way for Jews to understand their own religion within the context of modern American society, which is predominantly Christian.
 
 If you are interested in learning more about Judaism -- what do Jews believe? what is the Jewish religion all about? -- then I think this is a very good introduction.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations are easy to read and understand and at the same time very enlightening.  Don't let this be the extent of your studies into Judaism, but it is a fine place to start

136,"At first blush, the Everard family doesn't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors. Hugh, drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency, is in love with his brother John's wife. John, a general in the army in France, does not make an appearance, but his sons Nick and David do. Nick is feckless and irresponsible, just one step ahead of being drummed out of the Royal Navy himself, while David is more professional if somewhat dull. That in the course of the book, one's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character's past layer by layer, like peeling an onion.
 
 The criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing. Yes, the book is choppy and yes, it is hard to follow the course of the action. One's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix, but then you realize that this is the whole point. Fullerton's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the Battle of Jutland felt to those who were there. Jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events. Fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time. But you can't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative, just as even Lord Jellicoe wasn't able to do so. For that, you need to consult another book (I would recommend Rules of the Game by Andrew Gordon, which is not only the finest description of the battle, but one of the finest works of military history), but do it after you read this book, so that you get the full flavor of the writer's intent.

140,"Nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel.  A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative.  Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution.  All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward.  Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping.  The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts.  A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se.  Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad.  The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction.  Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing.  Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read.  Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended

By and large, however, this is a book by and for big firm attorneys.  It is about big firm angst and how it can be combated by hiring experts such as Dahut to do extensive consulting work for your firm.  Dahut does not acknowledge, and does not care, that most attorneys are solos or work in small firms, and that we have very different issues than agonizing over whether we have lost our soul by conforming to much to dead firm culture

143,"A exquisite exotic, as terrible in beauty, and sweet in dreamworlds as any penned since Poe, very much it's shadow. Vance weaves a world as bejeweled in color and fantastique as readers could imagine, in a earth perched at the end of time, while the sun sputters its last gasp. Magic rules, and poor Cugel, its hero wanders from  the lilac-flavoured poisons of Mazirian's garden to the autumn-cut glass palaces of the Dying Earth. He is betrayed, bewitched, and perplexed by his environs, all to our joy, and such is his adventures that we hope for more, but it takes a genius such as Vance to realize it.

145,"All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.
 
 And that's only the start of the plot. 
 
 Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.

Is love indeed an art? Why do we need it? What is the difference between love of a mother and a father (as archetypes)? He discusses different kinds of love: brotherly love (love to any other human being - just because he is a human being), erotic love, self-love, love to God. The last half of the book is dedicated to how love disintegrates in modern western society and how we can practice love.

148,"I may be repeating what others have said in previous reviews, but I just had to vent over this book. After reading Interview with the Vampire, and the other Vampire Chronicles before Merrick, I was highly disappointed over this book. The action and references to Voodun were vague and boring. The book revolves around a plot concocted by David Talbot and Louis the Vampire to use Merrick in order to contact the ghost of Claudia. Then, the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of Merrick Mayfair, a character Anne Rice fails to develop as a complex individual. The action in this book is cheesy, typical, and EXTREMELY predictable. The book introduces characters that are related to Merrick, and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader. The vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious, yet dangerous, and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels. The vampires in Merrick, especially Louis, are portrayed as weak and gutless. Yes, Louis is a tortured soul, but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel, and his weak nature is irritating to read about. Compare the vampires in Merrick to the same vampires portrayed in Queen of the Damned, like the characters of Akasha and Kayman, who enjoyed ""devouring the marrow from their victims' bones"". The vampires in Anne Rice's previous books captured the reader's attention with their viciousness, and vengeaful, yet human qualities. Anne Rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel Merrick as she did in her others. The action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction. The book is also full of references to David's annoying, perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales. Skip this novel, and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles, preferrably her early novels. This just does not cut it

I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger.

154,"If you're easily amused by anything that hyperactively draws attention to its &quot;cool&quot; sensibility, this book is for you. Stacey Richter obviously went to one too many writer's workshops where they pat each other on the back for their inside-ness and forget what real literature can be. None of her characters reveal any depth or texture. What little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy. Instead, what you get is exaggerated, absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence. Richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references, precious oddity, and patronizing first-person narration. Incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished, then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art. The word that best describes the whole thing is &quot;shallow.&quot; It's as if Richter were writing moment-to-moment, giggling over her cleverness, probably sipping an Orbitz because it's &quot;so stupid, it's sublime.&quot; After smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job (I'm looking down at my watch), perhaps Richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for Blind Date

This book focused on why we need ethics in business and how proper ethics enforcement can save a business from corruption and other questionable behavior which eventually may bring down a business (think Enron). It talked about both sides and didn't force someone's opinion on us rather helped us make our own decision which will be ethical and benefiting to the business.

169,"In England though she recently broke up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school, lives in a relatively happy all female home, and seems adjusted.  That is until she learns she is pregnant.
 
 Her mom Karen is a teacher's aide struggling with her mother Nan's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming. Her patience is over the edge when Charlotte informs her she is pregnant.  Upset and unable to contain her anger, Karen cannot believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to Karen.  Though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth.  She did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward.  As Nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted Karen, the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as Charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome.
 
 This fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother, a child having a child, the sandwich generation, and the creeping of dementia (as well as a late stroke).  When the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until Karen returns to her ""real"" family.  Somewhat a soap opera, THE BAD MOTHER'S HANDBOOK is a strong family drama that focuses on the demands and responsibilities on women without men.

170,"Yes it is!  As I sit here thinking about the experience of reading the book, and it is an experience I assure you,   I can tell you that there are slow periods in this ""story"" when you hope it will be ""over soon"".  So, don't expect an ""easy read"" on this one.  But the main idea is so ""universal"" and the story in its totality is so well written, that you forgive any ""lapses into boredom"" of the narrative.  In fact, that's partially what the book is about:  ""small town boredom"" of an intelligent and thoughtful and self examining lady in the early part of the 20th century. And, further, it's about the ""will to overcome"" and the  ""courage to overcome"" this boredom and pettiness of the small town by the main character who is a ""downtrodden female"" of that era.  I think this could be considered a ""woman's lib"" book.  As you read you will ""cheer on"" the main character, Carol, as she faces down the town pettitness and town bullies and even her somewhat staid but basically ""good guy"" husband.
 
 The main thing that is bugging Carol is this:  She ""hasn't found her true life's occupation"" and she feels ""trapped"" in the little podunk town of Gopher Prairie and in her marriage so that she'll never ""find her true self"". (wow, what a name for a town!o)   This theme is a universal theme because everyone, even men, have the same driving force of finding ""who am I"" and ""where do I really belong.""   It's a ""universal theme"".  Thus this is an ""important book"" to read if you have ever had similer thoughts and restiveness about ""where do I belong"" and ""what is my true purpose in life.""   Just keep reading past the ""slow parts"" and you'll find that your effort will be rewarded.  Email boland7214@aol.c

175,"I have read nearly all of Mr. Walsch's books. The CwG series IS the world's wake up call. You must have an open mind to be able to see the true depth of this series. At one time, I used to believe as the naysayers. Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is. People find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly. People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is. I submit, where is the version of the Bible before it was ordered to be edited by Emperor Constitine in 325? Do you want the truth? Simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis, will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are. ONLY IF you are truly honest with yourself and learn Meditation, you will then believe in these treasured works. I recommend ""Spiritual Breakthrough"" by John van Auken to learn meditation.

It's a combination alternate history-swashbuckler-magical fantasy set in the era of the war between Cavaliers and Roundheads, but with a difference: they have railroads already.  Well plotted, well paced, inventive, suspenseful, great descriptions.  Not too deep, though--just great fun.  Characters: Traditional but not stereotypical hero, heroine, sidekick, villain, a few historical figures, some familiar literary non-humans and a guest cameo appearance by a character from one of my other favorite stories of his.

He also displays that all-too-rare ability to use the English language of the past with complete accuracy, a skill the lack of which can easily break the spell of an effort which might have otherwise succeeded.

Described as a 'phallic' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility,' and as a, 'Solar emblem of the 'sky gods,' and later as an, 'emblem of Saint John the Babtist,' this is clearly a female iconic Goddess figure holding a double-sided LABRYS (axe) in each upraised arm.  The Labrys is a feminine symbol associated with the female Amazons that were Priestesses of Artemis, the Moon Goddess.  During their time, lunar energies were associated with the Goddess, and feminine power, NOT masculine, phallic, sky-Gods.

As an American living and working abroad for a US based pharmaceutical company, the working mother lifestyle is entirely different.  The 100 Best Companies to Work only applies to the U.S. headquarters.  The reality is different for the subsidiary or country operations, where resources are limited and the culture is not supportive of the ""flextime"" approach.  In fact it is worst, because country operations are forced to ""nudge"" the books and offer what they call contractual permanent roles (not the equivalent as an employee role), which deprive the working mother of the necessary benefits needed to achieve a work-life balance.  As an American living in Australia, I am appalled, if not dismayed by this severe discrepancy.  For Ex-Pats living abroad, don't be fooled by the list.

193,"Searching For Caleb had a new setting every five pages, family members who walked out and wouldn't have come back until they were ""kidnapped"", and chaotic events that led to a suicide, all of which made this book interesting in an unusual way.
 This book is first set on a train going to New York City in the year of 1972. Then the scene changes to Cairo Mill, Maryland. Suddenly it changes to Baltimore, Maryland in the 1800's. A bit later it changes to Baltimore in 1980. Anne Tyler told most of the story in Maryland, but at the end, she changes to Louisiana. The story was about the Peck family, which was a very sophisticated family. Wealthy, respectable, self-involved, they always wore hats.  Even the little girls never went out of the house without a hat on. Basically the story was about Daniel Peck's search for his brother, Caleb, who walked off in 1912. It was also about his granddaughter Justine Peck's realization that she will never be the Peck that she always dreamed to be. The concept of this book, then, is finding oneself.
 Daniel Peck's main conflict was evident in his search for Caleb. When Caleb was in his twenties he just walked out on the family and didn't return or make contact with any family member. The search started when Daniel moved in with Duncan and Justine Peck. Daniel spent years researching and visiting people who might have known Caleb. He would visit people that were Caleb's friends or appeared in pictures with Caleb. Unfortunately, he had absolutely no luck. So when Daniel's birthday came, his oldest son ""Two"" hired him a private investigator to search for Caleb. The private investigator headed straight to work asking questions. He found out that when Caleb was younger all one would have to do to find Caleb was ""Hold still a minute and listen."" He found out how Caleb loved music. He also went searching to Caleb's home in Baltimore.  Then the private investigator learned where Caleb was just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. The private investigator told the Pecks this but before Daniel could meet Caleb, Daniel died of a heart attack.
 This book was draining yet funny; mostly draining. The hardest part was keeping track of what part the story was in, whether the past or the present.  Also the Peck family was absolutely insane. Actually two cousins ended up married to each other. That caused so much chaos that a separation, a disowning and a suicide happened over the event. Then Justine and Duncan were constantly moving because Duncan would become restless and wanted a change. Justine just went along very easily but Meg, their daughter, hated moving. She locked herself in the bathroom a few times.  Daniel did not begin looking for his brother for practically 30 years after Caleb walked out. The comical parts were the best. For instance, all the time that Daniel was searching for Caleb his old maid knew right where Caleb was. When Caleb left, he had told her where he was going. Yet she never told anyone because no one ever asked her. In addition, Duncan would cut out newspaper clippings and stick them to things.  To the old Ford that the door was torn off he stuck a clipping that said ""Wouldn't you rather have a Buick?"". When Meg bought an expensive dress, his cut out was ""Have you ever had a bad time in Levi's?"" One of Justine's neighbor was divorced and the father of her child who had no visiting rights would come and take the daughter. The mother would scream and shout about her daughter being kidnapped, yet every night the father brought the child home safe and sound.
 This book was very interesting, but a strange kind of interesting.  It never really caught my attention; rather it often put me to sleep.  It was summer reading, the kind you get on a book list.  I would suggest it to people if they didn't really have anything else to read. But some will like it. I found it too scattered in place and time and too slow moving.

The model is the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, but I don't think it works.

I guess the New York Times Book Review should have tipped me off because they compare it to Frank Herbert's Dune and the Foundation series of Asimov, both of which, in my opinion have aged really badly. I never realized how bad Dune was until I saw the awful movie of it.

209,"Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance.  It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting.
 
 Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him. 
 
 The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many ""z's"" and ""v's.""
 
 On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like.  And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either.

211,"This is an excellent short review of European quest for a language to unite its disparate nations with each other and the rest of the world. I thought that the book did an excellent job of staying on the subject and illustrating the progression of thought in this area. It does confine itself to Europe and time period as defined in the beginning of the book. That is excellent, there is simply no other way to cover as much ground as the book attempts to do, and I feel that it does suceed admirably. As usual, Eco's erudition and research are amazing. This book is published in the context of a European series of books about Europe and I wish there was a similar book series that would cover this ground for Far East and India as well. I am sure people there worked on the same kind of problems. Some of the problems with languages and methods described seem so obvious that one has to wonder what the authors themselves thought about them. Of course, this is a whole other book series. I wish there was a 4 1/2 rating as I do not think this is truly a masterpiece, but certainly a very very good book from a very very good author of fiction and non-fiction. A bonus for fans of Focault's Pendulum -- a lot of data in that fiction book refers to work discussed in this non-fiction work. Great fun

I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as ""dear heaven"" and ""lord"" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.

216,"Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.
 
 Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.
 
 As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.
 
 For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.
 
 I now appreciate the ""cliffhanger"" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.
 
 Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written

 Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.

219,"James Patterson's work over a decade ago stopped consistently being masterpiece after masterpiece and became very hit and miss with very average novels published throughout most of his recent career, with only the odd great read every now and then published, with readers just keep picking up each successive novel hoping the old quality will be back.  Well I'm pleased to say, it is back with The Angel Experiment.  I must admit I was very surprised as Patterson's last attempt at the children's market SantaKid, well as those of us unfortunate enough to have read it know, pitiful is being nice.  With Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment, quality is achieved albeit for a much older children's market than SantaKid.  Well actually I don't even know why the publishers say this is a kids book (young adult) as it is even more violent than the two adult novels in this series and although it has been a while since I read When the Wind Blows and The Lake House I didn't really notice any differences in the way they are written.   Obviously it's just a marketing thing by the publishers to sell more books in this series.  Although you could read this as a stand alone novel you really do need to have previously read the two adult novels before this as well to understand and enjoy this story to its full extent, so marketing this and the subsequent novels in this series as a younger age group doesn't make much sense but adults will love this book anyway. 
 
 In Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment, Max and the five other kids with wings are back for the third instalment in the series.  They are happily living in their secluded hide out which Jed, the good scientist from the School who unfortunately met his demise in the previous books set up for them.  Their peaceful existence is smashed however when the youngest girl Angel is taken by Erasers (bad creations from the school).  Max takes control and organises a rescue mission where the children all discover they have other powers they haven not tapped into yet. The mission will take them not only to the rural school but to New York and the answers to their past they so have longed for all their lives.  Some unpleasant surprises are on the way for Max and the others that will repulse them beyond any level they've endured before!

Batman actually points a gun at someone?  Yeah, right again.  The big blue schoolboy saves the universe? Hack, ptooey.

221,"I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them.  They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.  
 
 I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.
 
 Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.
 
 As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate. 
 
 The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy. 
 
 I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin

222,"This book provides a nice mix of tofu and non-tofu dishes that are easy to make with very few ingredients.  The other plus of the book is that easy doesn't mean just combining two canned foods to make a meal, but rather emphasizes fresh (usually healthy) ingredients.

223,"The book I read is a pretty fun book! The book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is a book where a boy runs away from the city to the mountains. He finds out how to live.
 
 Later he gets a pet falcon and names it Frightful. Soon he finds a man, but he thinks he's a bandit, then he becomes friends with the man. The boy, Sam, finds out he's a professor. He's good at making jam too.
 
 Before the winter he has Halloween with the animal friends he has made, and invites them to his house inside a tree, but it doesn't turn out well after the party.
 
 Sam kills some deer and rabbit to make clothes for the winter. He wears the rabbit's fur as underwear because it's waterproof. 
 
 After the winter his parents and sister come to visit him, but they are going to live in a cabin instead of his tree house, so he gets angry but later calms down. I think the writer wants the reader to try running away. I like it because I think I would try running away in the mountains to see what happens. 
 
 I highly recommend this book for both parents and kids to read.

224,"The best thing about Case Histories is that it is not a murder mystery. Kate Atkinson's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe, unsolved crimes, supernumerary suspects, and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters. 
 
 I was pleased by the lifelike, sympathetic presentation of the two male characters. Unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page. 
 
 The plot of Case Histories consists of three unrelated cold cases. All the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution. But this resolution fails to materialize. The detective solves one murder, the perpetrator casually confesses to a second, and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback. And the cats live happily ever after

225,"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS

The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.

229,"This was an interesting read.  Napolitano is a Fox News Contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the Constitution literally for it's intended meaning.  As a result, the Fox News bashers will tend to ignore the book but it's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the Constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the Patriot Act.  In an unbiased way (politically), his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse.  I've traditionally been a supporter of the Republicans and the Patriot act but the Judge's book have made me rethink the Patriot Act.  I was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go, some dating back to Hamilton and Jefferson themselves

234,"I purchased Eldredge's ""Wild at Heart"", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given ""Waking the Dead"" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up. 
 
 John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like ""The Matrix"" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it. 
 
 The author also presents the image of God as ""my friend"". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway. 
 
 This is exactly the same theology as building the largest ""Christian"" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to ""offend anyone"". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't. 
 
 Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of ""setting hearts free"". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not ""free"" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, ""Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ""...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service. 
 
 For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend ""The Way of the Master"" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.

I started with Chapter eight because it was the chapter on ""war"".  I was expecting the normal war stuff, but instead I got a lesson in something much more important.  I have started to learn how to listen to my body through pain and sickness.  I never thought back and neck pain were anything more that a nuisance, but the author tells me in her book that they are messages.  Maybe that five mile run was too much, maybe fighting with my wife or avoiding phone calls from my mother was not the best course of action and the only way my body knew to tell me was to make me feel pain. I have since recommended this book to all of the guys!  It's not what you expect from a book about relationships

I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is.

Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns.  He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker.  The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read.  This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others

242,"I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book. 
 
 The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the ""normal"" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: ""I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee"" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over. 
 
 Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored. 
 
 I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.

243,"I'm at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read.  This book did the trick..  The narrator is smart, funny, and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world.  Certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives, one at a time.  (Or maybe I'm just jaded, too.  Some may call it maturity.)  Clearly, the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people (from both sides of the tracks).  Ironically, his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals.   Anyway, join Max as he watches pathetic people with and without class, power, and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have, and help him make sense of it.  Great literature this ain't, but a smart, fun, cynical read it is

244,"My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the ""adult"" books from the library. 
 
 I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.  
 
 It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.
 
 If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series

248,"I want to respond to this book and all voices given.
 Some said that it points out how Turks eliminated Greek etc. in the 15th century from Asia. Well, if it should get historical, people would know that Turks already started to settle down in Asia around 10th- to 11th century. The population was getting crowded with Turks than (old) Greeks. Fights have been fought Byzants against the Selcuks. The Byzantiniens didn't like the way Asia was getting more and more full with Turks. Wars have been fought, Byzans lost the war, Ottoman Empire succeeded, easy so far I hope to follow.
 Coming to the situation at 20th Century, the so called ""holocaust"" at Greeks and Armenians. Everybody knows that Britain used the Greeks and Armenians to get access to Iraq, which didnt exist as a country at that time, because of oil which most of you should know. Greeks and Armenians were used so British could get more access to Iraq and other nations with a lot of oil, like Kuwait etc. 
 So, Greeks started to rebell and Armenians, too. Thousands of Turks were killed in West and East-Asia. The answer for ongoing slaughters on the Turkish population was to relocate the Armenians, at East Asia, who made troubles and Greeks, at West Asia. BUT, no body could know who were the trouble makers, so it was decided that the whole population has to move away if Turkey wanted to claim those lands. Greeks did the same at these day Greek teritory, Northeast Greece. Northeast Greece was populated mostly with Turks, but they ""had"" to move because of the killing Greeks did on the Turkish population there, so Turkish and Greekish gov't decided to move their populations. Greek got their populations back from West-Asia, safely, and Turks their own from Ottoman lands (nowadays, Northeast Greece).
 OH, did I forget to point out that it was ""normal"" for nations to move away populations of the 'other' kind because of the problem, if more people of another kind live there they were able to claim it. So, even Greece and other nations did this THING, it was normal to do at those times.
 So to point out, it is biased, this book. Turks did their best in relocating the whole Armenians but didn't have enough supplies, which ended in couple of thousand of deaths which is still nothing compared to the deaths of the Turks. Yes, it was a tragedy, but every nation has one, even the Turks. The holocaust at Cyprus in the 1900's-1970's at the Turkish population. The unaccounted numbers of violations against humanity against Turks at Bulgaria (19th-20th century), Greece(until the 1980's and 90's), Russia (19th-21st century), Cyprus (19th century-1970's), and West-China(until these days).
 People should be more aware of history, and reading this book it was said to see how biased people are against people like my nation, people, and myself.
 Armenians living in Turkey have no troubles, I ask myself, why? Freedom of religion was always granted in Turkey. Even these days the Greek gov't doesn't allow a mosque in Athen, I ask myself why? There are orthodox-churches in Turkey.
 Hatred causes blindness! Keep an open mind and read a good book which tells the truth story.

250,"I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option

251,"I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered. 
 
 I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.
 
 If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there.

258,"Were you to read only one Wodehouse book (God forbid) which one might it be? I would suggest this one, although there are numerous contenders from the Jeeves, Drones, golf, Mr. Mulliner and Blandings stories, not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns.
 
 Although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative, being that all the tales are told in the first person by one Bertie Wooster, the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat ""cliffhanger"" endings, which is to say they don't resolve.
 
 That almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel, and also spun off some of the best TV yarns in the Jeeves and Wooster and World of Wodehouse TV series.
 
 My British edition (for copyright reasons not for sale in the U.S.) shows a cover photo op of Ian Carmichael as Wooster in the BBC series ""The World of Wooster"". As PGW noted, this was one of many instances where Bertie was overly mature and greyed; there seems a deliberate attempt to make Carmichael seem older-- whereas most readers, Wodehouse included, see him as somewhat youngish. 
 
 In Wodehouse Playhouse, which includes brief vignettes of PGW, he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting Bertie somewhat younger. Even better was the stellar performance in Jeeves and Wooster, in which ""Pearls Mean Tears"" ""Comrade Bingo"" and a number of these other chapters, expanded into episodes, appear. No wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read

266,"This book is great for identifying problems that may be affecting you, it defines each problem very clearly, and there is a test in the beginning to help you figure out which problem areas are at the top of the list. It even gives examples of how these problem areas affect certain situations to clarify. 
 
 The problem with this book is the advice. A lot of it is very simple, and winds up contradicting itself. Some of it is not even helpful or good advice. Take for example the idea that one should ignore insults, in the chapter about Personalizing. It states that if you don't consistently ignore someone who is insulting you, it's called 'letting it get to you'. However, it's actually called 'letting someone walk all over you' and a better book would advise you to learn to be assertive and tell the person to stop, THE FIRST TIME, and if the person doesn't stop, to leave. Also, at the end of the chapter, is a real problem as well. He writes a scenario with a mother who made homemade salad dressing and her son doesn't like it. He then makes it sound as though it is okay for you to sit there and silently demean your own son in your head because of his personal tastes, saying stuff to yourself like he has an inability to appreciate good food, and that he is not the ultimate world judge of salad dressing worthiness (whilst true, this would imply the mother would think  that SHE is the ultimate world judge and is being quietly condescending), and that if she serves him bottled salad dressing next time and he complains, she can explain the error (in this case his personal tastes are considered WRONG) of his ways. This right here is an extremely poor model of appropriate thought behavior! Obviously the mother in the example is a bit of a narcissist and harmfully not allowing her son to have his own personal tastes without criticism. Things like this are why I refuse to give this book any review that makes it sound great.  
 
 So definitely take this book with a heaping pile of salt. Please don't let it be your self-help bible. There are other ways of acting that would be much much better than the advice given in this book.

So, this book lay gathering dust on my bookshelf, until one day I completely ran out of novels to read. I picked it up, and I was captivated after the first few pages. I didn't want to start the book without reading the ones prior. Fortunately, Jonathan Kellerman is a good enough writer to write a series that does not have to be read in order!
 This novel-The Clinic-is one of the most fast paced that I've ever read. I could not put this book down for the life of me. I had to know the who's, the when's, why's, and how's that were so skillfully placed!

This time he looks at tying and gives many practical tips--especially on the use of tools and materials. For example, a beginner is hit with all these tools--which ones are best, which ones to use, etc. Rosenbauer gives clear descriptions of which tools are most useful, what they're used for, and which ones you don't really need. At the same time, he gives tips from his experience--also useful for the expert.
 
 The bulk of the book is, of course, the fly-tying receipes. He provides many photographs of each step in making a fly. The many photos are probably more than the expert will need, but very important for a beginner. For the expert, you get many great fly receipes.

271,"Maggie Balistreri's critique of our masked, substantively evasive dialect offers humorous, albeit troubling, insight into how much of the social fabric, the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes, are entrenched in mass denial, subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common, everday conversations and exchanges.
 Think of it as speaking in riddles. Unfortunately, it's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse. 
  
 This particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level, to the extent that it's accepted as 'normal'.
 Let's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness, a soul sickness; isn't it possible, even likely, that over time, a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ...*as a disease?* 
 And by that postulation, wouldn't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick, weird, bad, wrong, etc? 
 
 With people generally unaware of this process(and likely uninterested in it)they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient, or at least insufficient, mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception, mass deception, and in turn, self and societal censorship.  
 
 This elaborate process largely stems from the ""Just Do It"" corporatized mentality. The underlying, strategic message of ""Just Do It"" is DON'T THINK. That is, don't think beyond the superficialities of life: of a mindless, wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism, and all it entails to define human worth and ""success"" on such terms.
 
 When people don't think beyond those terms, when the customary, daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities, often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy, fear, anxiety, the result is an unthinking, non critical, homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought, genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged, enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis. 
 Logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency, its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are, allowing for a delusional, happy consciousness. Language reflects this.
 
 My take on what Maggie is addressing in her book isn't a random social trend, and that there isn't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person's overall intelligence or vocabulary; it's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous, corporatized values. 
 The proof is how corporate power, which is basically the hierarchy of government, so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity. 
 The greater the degree of ignorance, apathy, and general disharmony, the greater profits to be made from human misery, and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified, perpetuating the cycle.
 
 The psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so.
 If they're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import(something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite)than naturally, the people's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset.

276,"After seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book I was eager to buy it for my recent trip to Mexico City. Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. For starters, the maps are woefully inadequate. There aren't enough of them, they lack sufficient detail, and there is no number and letter grid system. That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical. Making matters worse, the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended. I have had far better books than this when I have visited other parts of the world. I have to think someone makes a better Mexico City guide too

But none of those can compare to the hatred I have for this book and my curiosity to read it! I honestly don't know where to start; there are certain FACTS which he has tried to work his way around or completely dodge. FOr instance, the videogame Killer7, he claims it has a full blown on sex scene, however I have played this and there is nothing over PG rated! He also mentions criticising the ESRB without offering any proof for what he says! The same could be said for grammar and spelling, it was completely atrocious, it is unforgivable that he is a lawyer and I believe a 16 year old could do better! What I found worse about him is the fact he gives out false threats, he threatened Rockstar Games to pull their GTA games from the shelves or he would bring a law suit to them... nothing happened! The last thing I would like to say about the book is he leaves out the negative things about him such as offering to donate $10,000 to charity if someone were to make a game of a father killing video game designers. About two or three of these games appeared on the internet and he refused to help charities. In the long run, I believe that the perception of Jack Thompson has gone bad to worse after releasing this book.

282,"Wow. I was shocked. Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' It is disingenuous for Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus. He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the ""patronizing nonsense"" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, ""...a religionless Christianity must be born."" Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been absent and not around to defend himself.
 
 I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was also interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.
 
 I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.
 
 Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Spong) to take the very (true) words I have just said in this paragraph and make it sound convincingly like, ""You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...blah blah blah.""
 
 I offer one piece of advice. However, I admit I base this advice on my belief that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.

It explains the Glass Ceiling and Self Sabotage phenomena very well.
 
 The only reason this book doesn't get a 5 star rating, is that it's a little weak on how to effectively address, the emotional issues it talks about. There are far more effective ways of addressing these issues, but this book does give you a good start.
 
 I'd recommend it.

285,"Over the years (decades actually), Peter Eisenman's ""Terragni"" took on something of the urban myth, an elusive, unpublished work, supposedly of great genius.  Draft copies were jealously hoarded by a few insiders adding to the myth.  Now, after 40 years, it appears in print, no longer only the stuff of legend, but an actuality exposed to real scrutiny.  Frankly, the wait has not been worth it.  Exhaustively drafted from every conceivable projection and angle, the images of the building are accompanied by a text (a `critical text', the author repeatedly informs us), that pushes the limits only of the ridiculous.  For example: the plan of the Casa del Fascio, Eisenman ""discovers"", is a square, or rather, almost a square.  In order to satisfy Eisenman's supposition, the true square, it seems, is realized only when particular window is opened fully to the 90 degree position, thereby implying a volumetric extension of the building, which then completes the so-called purity of the geometry.  The fact that other windows on other sides of the building might also be opened at the same time thereby undermining the purported geometrical purity, does not seemed to have occurred to the author so blinded is he by the supposed brilliance of this, the most pretentious of studies. Numerous equally untenable speculations flesh out the remainder of this overwrought, but ultimately fruitless examination.  Terragni's classical parti is studiously avoided by the author who is largely ignorant of the precepts that underlie this, the most basic formal arrangement that Terragni carried through his design.  Eisenman stretches similar guesswork beyond the point of irritation as though insulting the intelligence of his readers is one of the underlying purposes of this book.  In the architectural industry, asinine speculation, masquerading as theory or as philosophical inquiry, are now the norm. This particular book has been billed as Peter Eisenman's ""eagerly awaited magnum opus"".   Certainly the Casa del Fascio is deserving of study.  However, if perchance ""Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critiques"" does achieve long-lasting fame, it can only be for becoming the late 20th Century's high water mark of architectural pretentiousness and unbounded historical ignorance.

289,"Adams is clearly a thoughtful Christian man who cares about husbands and wives. My problem: his definition of those roles are too old-fashioned and rigid for my taste. Just so you know, I am not a liberal woman who either ignores the Bible or is ignorant of its teaching; I know the Biblical teachings on marriage and it is their instructions I disagree with Adams about. He consistently calls the wife the ""helper"", which diminishes the aspect of partnership that I believe marriage should be. A leader and a helper is not a partnership, it is basically one central figure and a secondary figure who helps them. Adams stresses the specialness of a helper to uplift the concept, but is apparently unaware that the role still pushes a sense of lesserness on the woman's side because, if a wife is a helper, who is she helping? The husband! The man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate, but his ""helper"", a moon revolving around a sun. His beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of, in regards to a wife's role, taking the Biblical word ""Submit"" and turning it into ""obey"". Honey, they're not the same. Submission, unlike obedience, can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority. The concept of marital submission, I believe, is basically to surrender to another's needs and put the other before oneself; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying! Therefore, Adam's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect. Certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife, but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs. The Bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary; that is HUGE submission on the husband's part. Submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other, but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other. 
 
 Adams' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me, especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful ""command"" from her husband. If a husband freely commands his wife, we've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not. Adam's advice for the wife to ""respectfully"" refuse a sinful command also rather threw me, since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple. His idea of what to say to such a husband? ""I must respectfully say no. You must not ask me to sin and I cannot do that."" Firstly, if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that (or command it, in Adams' words), he'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got. Secondly, I defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way. The monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that Adams' taken this obedience thing a little too far. This impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who ""has not been a good helper"". His advice: ""They (wives) must be trained to put on helpful deeds, a step many counselors overlook."" Maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is, rightly, obsolete for most people. 
 
 Books like these, which so rigidly define the roles of spouses, have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage (not an easy thing to do, but they manage). They oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives, the marriage will go swimmingly. It is NOT that simple! Marriage is not a recipe with instructions, it's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas, and conflicts will NOT magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other. This method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own. 
 
 Every marriage is different; it should be Godly, of course, but you cannot make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter. Christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the Bible too literally. Adams does this by saying that, because the Bible tells the husband and not the wife to love, loving is primarily the husband's job. He went on to say that, if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage, his counselor should tell him that it's mainly his fault! Honestly, this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers (what kind of counselors are these, anyway?). To automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the Bible instead of what's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary (if a professional counselor does this, it's downright terrifying). The interpretation itself is rather skewed; the Bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally. It does NOT mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect, so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly. There are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting; you cannot simply assume which spouse is at fault because of Biblical instructions. 
 
 This is not a bad book, but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as Adams, it probably won't do much for you. If it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse, it would've worked a lot better for me.

Almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts (while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course), demonizing the Million Man March, whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim.  If it were a black man writing this foolishness, he'd be written off as an angry old coot in a minute.  Well that's exactly what Jill Nelson is as far as I'm concerned.

294,"I learned a great deal from Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) through his text, &quot;On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism&quot;.  Dr Bernard McGinn, Divinity School, University of Chicago, wrote in the introduction, &quot;I believe that all students of mysticism should read Scholem, not only for his profound insights into the Jewish mystical tradition, but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- Christian, Islamic, and even those further afield.&quot;  Professor Scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches.  &quot;From an historical point of view&quot;, he writes, &quot;the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others.&quot;  Within this context, this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries.  In the first chapter, &quot;Religious Authority and Mysticism&quot; Herr Doktor Scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research, &quot;there is no mysticism as such, but only the mysticism of particular religious systems, Christian, Islamic and Jewish mysticism, and so on&quot;.  The mystic working within a religious system is, according to Scholem, at the same time both conservative and revolutionary.  &quot;Conservative&quot; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority, and &quot;revolutionary&quot; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority.  In the second chapter, titled, &quot;The Meaning of the TORAH in Jewish Mysticism&quot;, Scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the TORAH and the mystic.  Scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the Kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the TORAH are based: (1) YWVH; (2) TORAH as oganism; (3) Infinite meaning of the divine word.  As an example of the third, in addition to the the concept of written and oral TORAHs, the author of the &quot;ZOHAR&quot; speculates four levels of meaning: (1) literal (2) hermeneutic (3) allegorical and (4) mystical.  The history of Judaism, Scholem explains in the third chapter, is a tension between the purity of the reality of GOD.  The dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of GOD's purity is the loss of her living reality.  Scholem offers that the Book Bahir, a cornerstone of 12th century Kabbalistic thought, introduces myth into Judaism.  Remarkably, it contends evil as an attribute of GOD.  In a similar vein, the commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah by Judah ben Barzilai introduced speculative thinking to Jewish theosophy.  The fourth chapter, &quot;Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists&quot; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation.  Namely, how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium.  The Mishnal codified Jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries.  As the agrarian society diminished, the TORAH became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful, historical rituals.  The Spanish Kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions.  Scholem writes, &quot;The rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols, even when these are 'spiritualized' and transformed into speculative constructions.&quot;  R. Yanassan Gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the Golem.  I will take the liberty to direct you to his comments.  If you are interested in historical issues of the Kabbalah, this is essential reading for you

 Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book.  After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are.  Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here.  Was there any quality control as this book went to press?  And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum.  Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.  Just, well,  disappointing.  If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.

300,"Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at. 
 
    A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is ""Feel the fear and do it anyway"" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful. 
 
     I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.

307,"Sacrifice of the Widow by Lisa Smedman is the first book in the Lady Penitent trilogy. For fans of the Forgotten Realms, this book follows up on the events of the six book series War of the Spider Queen. So, before I start this review, if you have yet to read the War of the Spider Queen series, I strongly suggest you do before you read this as events from that series are talked about, and have consequences, in this book. If you choose to read this book, and most likely this trilogy, without reading WotSQ then there may be some things that just don't make sense - So consider yourself warned.
 
 The plot of this book is not your traditional plot, in that it is not really one linear plot with a few sub-plots sprinkled in. The sub-plots are very good and hint at much larger ramification that will more than likely transpire in the next two books. There is the sub-plot of what really happened to Hallisstra Melarn at the end of the sixth WotSQ book, and how she became what she is now. There is a sub-plot of the followers of Eilstraee fighting followers of tow other entities. There is also a sub-plot of a larger `battle' between Lolth and Eilstraee. Ms. Smedman does a wonderful to weave all these sub-plots together to create not only an engaging story, but a seamless one at that. When the sub-plots shift between one another there is not much transition that throws the pace of the book off at all. The overall plot is very well written and easy to follow.
 
 There are several characters in this book. This is both a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. With all the different sub-plots there needed to be many characters to keep everything going. However, with this amount of characters there is less time for them to be developed fully so the reader has a better connection with them. There are a few characters that I would have definitely liked to read more about, and maybe that will be remedied in the next two books. Don't get me wrong, there was some character development in this book, such as that of Hallisstra, her brother Q'arlynd both had significant development. Yet, the majority of the characters had little development. I believe that was just a part that had to suffer due to how much the plots of this book needed to be explained.
 
 Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. This is not your traditional Drow novel in that it's not strictly about subterfuge and chaos. The pace of this book is very good and Ms. Smedman's writing lends itself to be easily read. It's very easy to read through one hundred pages and wonder where the time went. With some Drow books, the authors try to make these huge grand flourishes of prose, yet in this book Ms. Smedman seems conserved and this creates an easy feel.
 
 If you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms and have read the WotSQ series you will undoubtedly enjoy this book for the continuation of that storyline. If you are a fan of fantasy in general and know a little about the Forgotten Realms I still believe you will enjoy this novel, although some things may not make much sense to you. At any rate, if you are considering reading this, I have no qualms about recommending it. It's a very nice addition to the Forgotten Realms universe.

 I bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support. I found it in the ""Self-Help"" section of the bookstore.
 
 This little book does as good a job as anything I've read, at getting in a woman's head. Clothes are how we remember. Wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope. 
 
 For a while, I kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever I'd want to remember an important event. Ask me what I was wearing when I held my niece for the first time (navy blue A-line Liz Claiborne dress) or when I went to my first job interview out of college (a polka-dot suit I called The Stewardess) or the night I was first kissed by the love of my life (a shirt that said ""Keep On Truckin"" in glitter... heh).
 
 A good friend's mother passed away a few months ago, and I bought a copy for her, since Ms. Beckerman mentions the death of her own mother. She also mentions marriages, divorces, babies, and career successes, and most importantly, what she wore.

311,"Fran Lebowitz is sometimes referred to as the successor to Dorothy Parker. A few similarities are apparent. Both are sharp-witted, female New Yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners. Yet, if Parker could be considered a painter of the urban American landscape in the 1920s through 1950s, Lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s. I don't think she has Parker's depth or sense of structure. Her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin. And she often relies way too heavily on puns. Several pieces in this collection fall flat for me. Yet others - such as her advice to heiresses, ""At Home with Pope Ron,"" and ""The Last Laugh"" - were quite clever. I think she's worth reading as perhaps one of the leading humorists of her generation. Comparisons with the more versatile and compelling Parker are a bit of a stretch, though

313,"The work of Duncan J. Watts was admittedly inspired by the work of social-psychologist at Harvard University, Stanley Milgram, in the late 1967 on experiment on the problem called ""small world"" problem: ""anyone person in the world could be reached through a network of friends in only a few steps; in Watts language, ""after the cocktail party banter in which two strangers discover that they have a mutual acquaintance and remind each other what ""a small world"" it is. Surprisingly, Milgram's results led to the phrase ""six degrees of separation"": the degree of network of friends between me and you will never be more than six! I know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone that knows someone who becomes my friend!
 
 I feel a must to urge the readers to read the book in order to understand further what science of network can give us. Among the popular books of networks, reading Watts' Six Degrees is important since the book was made seriously by the author for unlimited readers. It is a time for physics gives something valuable on constructing new scientific sociological work to day.

315,"Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, ""to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River."" (Nash, xxviii)  Nash bemoans how the ""great men"" still ""dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]"" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with ""historical amnesia,"" (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the ""great men"" clique.  He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society.  These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population.  
 
 Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories.  To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament.  He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way.  In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City.  Led by Ethan Allen, the ""Green Mountain Boys,"" as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property.  (Nash, 110 - 114)  He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well.  (Nash, 73 - 79)  In the case of the ""Green Mountain Boys,"" their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon.
 
 Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution.  In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era.  In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state.  He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution.  (Nash, 271 - 286)  In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook.  (Nash, 302 - 304)
 
 The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies.  These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land.  This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59)  What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise.  (Nash, 37 - 39)  What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown.  (Nash, 157 - 164)  Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land.  Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves.  (Nash, 64)  He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland.  (Nash, 426 - 427) 
 
 Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict.  First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution.  Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective.  This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands.  If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation.  (Nash, 141 - 144)  Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities.  Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed.  In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices.  (Nash, 232 - 235)
 
 The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations.  Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion.  (Nash, 151 - 157)  What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' ""genocidal"" policies towards the native population.  (Nash, 377 - 381)
 
 Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution.  That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare.  There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters.  As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, ""The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government.""  (Wood, 5)  Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along ""local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences.""  These complexities made, ""any generalization about Americans as a whole,"" quite difficult.  (Wood, 6)
 
 Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work.  Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the ""New Republic Online"":
 Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution.  This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it.  Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument.  Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes.  The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare.  (Wood, ""New Republic Online Review)
 
 
 Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated:
 But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare?  There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes.  Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future. 
 
 In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom.  Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves.  Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to ""expose"" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their ""elitists"" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below.  There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people.  To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a ""tyranny of the masses"" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation.
 
 However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points.  Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers.  Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case.  It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here.  What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell.  Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector.  To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era.  Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed?
 
 Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries.  This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution.  When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to ""tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution.""  (Nash, 367)  However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort.  Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan.  (Nash, 395)  If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it?  Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large.
 
 Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the ""Newburgh Conspiracy.""  It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities.  (Nash, 370 - 371)  However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy.  The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power.  Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again.
 
 Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era.  He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously.  However, I would like to offer my own take on this.  Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation?  I certainly think not.  Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself.  In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life.  Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, ""You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!""  (Douglass, 53)  While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind.
 
 Nash lamented the ""genocidal policies"" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution.  While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history.  Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World.  In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable.  However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions.  Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force.  
  
 Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution.  (Nash, xv)  First, I would ask Mr. Nash, ""should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?""  While historians do deal with the ""great men"" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below.  Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war.  We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise.  We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country.  
 
 What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution.  Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records.  Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences.  Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures.
 
 Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored.  Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side.  Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers.
 
 The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well.  Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution.  Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it.  Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution.
 
 The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals.  Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict.  Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South.  Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion.
 
 Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution.  The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few ""Founding Fathers,"" but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class.  Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in.
 
 These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more.  These books are not hard to find.  Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields.  To be sure, there will still be authors who write biographies on the ""great men"" of the American Revolution, but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict.  Thus, Nash is not the lone voice for these ""forgotten"" as he claimed

318,"I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;.  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book

319,"I would have given this no stars if it were an option. 
 
 The first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me. Judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind, but only occasionally scientific fraud. He seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world, we will get fired up and join him in a lynching. 
 
 His tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him. This is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with. He laces his information with references to ""the epidemic"" of fraud and nobody being ""immune"" to it, as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions. I suspect that Judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer.

320,"These stories, as read by the great actor Paul Winfield, are powerful testaments to life, love, hard times, etc..  These stories and their central character, Socrates Fortlow, are fine examples of a man, who did wrong, seeks redemption, and tries hard to make amends.  The continuing theme of the crime which he committed ties them all together.  Mr. Winfield's reading cuts across all racial barriers, to teach all of us, black and white, about one man's struggle(s) with his demons.  His reading also adds passion and depth to Mr. Mosley's writing.  I'd highly recommend these stories (in audio and print).  [Refers to the audio edition.

321,"This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I can sincerely state I will not read another. 
 The way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous. No one - and no one, speaks that way. It made the story feel rushed and stilted, and I am sad to say, much of the humor was lost on me. Something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it. I felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues.
 I found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly (something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them), and the abuse situations Ms. Coulter touched on, then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting. She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way. If she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed....miserably.

325,"This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's ""advice,"" but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her ""advice"" on infant feeding--she presented the section as ""common considerations when deciding to breastfeed"" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, ""reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it"" section. 
 
 I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent ""perfect mother"" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either

327,"`The Foster's Market Cookbook' by Sara Foster, with Sarah Belk King, I bought in my `buy everything I saw on the Food Network' phase, especially after I saw Sarah Foster demonstrate her killer sticky bun recipe on the Food Network's `In Martha's Kitchen' show. This was also in my sticky bun-baking period, before I gave it up as too much work and went back to straight breads.
 
 One of the main reasons the book sat unopened on my shelves for so long was the fact that the `killer sticky bun' recipe was simply not that killer. Do not believe anyone when they say they have an easy sticky bun recipe, because it probably means the end result will fall below expectations. Around the same time, I did a sticky bun recipe from funny baker Wayne Harley Brachman, and that one didn't come up to snuff anyway. Leave it to Julia Child to come through for me. I did the sticky bun recipe in `Baking with Julia' and it was a LOT of work, but it in fact surpassed anything you can get from the mall.
 
 But getting back to Sarah Foster's book, I have come back to it because I harbored s suspicion that there was some really good stuff in the book, and I was not disappointed.
 
 Part of my attraction is that I am a sucker for any cookbook that covers sandwiches. While I think Foster's sandwich recipes are not as interesting or as complete as those in Nancy Silverton's whole book devoted to the subject, they are a great resource if you happen to have no other source of ideas for sandwiches.
 
 Otherwise, the book covers everything you would expect, and it is especially strong on topics where you would expect expertise such as muffins, biscuits, scones, soups, salads, and egg dishes. On one of my favorite criteria for evaluating cookbooks, the recipe for a classic French omelet, Foster comes through like a champ. The only omelet tip she does not follow is to let the eggs come to room temperature before cracking and beating them, but then, this is probably quite impractical for a restaurant kitchen.
 
 She is also quite good on another of my favorite criteria, the making of stocks. Her recipes are very good for non-foodies and people who care not for haute cuisine, as they do not take very long to produce a very acceptable chicken, vegetable, or beef stock. My only reservations may be that some of her suggestions may lead to waste perfectly good poached chicken on the one hand and include less than edible vegetable cuttings into stocks. There is a reason some people are hyperfussy about stock making. These are but two of the reasons.
 
 I fully endorse Ms. Foster's recipes for muffins, biscuits, and scones. They are as good or better than recipes I have seen in books by professional bakers and books specializing in these subjects.
 
 The hardest aspect of whether it is worth buying this book is how if will complement your current cookbook collection. If you are a cookbook collector, the question is moot. Nothing will stop you from getting this notable title. On the other hand, if all you have is `The Joy of Cooking', this would be a welcome supplement, as like fellow Martha Stewart alumnae, Ina Garten's early cookbooks, all the recipes come from a commercial kitchen which depends on their products for good business and the products are relatively easy to make.
 
 This also means that the selection of recipes is very good fare for church bazaars and bake sales. While Foster is downsizing her recipes to household serving numbers, I am sure that her soups would work well at two to four to eight times her recipe size. Just be a little careful on multiplying some of the spicier ingredients.
 
 I find all the recipes extremely well written. They are full of important details for amateur chefs and unlike some books, everything is printed in good old fashioned black and white with a little highlight shading here and there for sidebars. And, several dishes are presented in living color photographs, and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of Foster's Market staff and customers. My only argument with the layout of the book is the chapter title pages where the names of the recipes are written in a kind of multicolored hodgepodge, similar to the maddening typography in Jamie Oliver's otherwise excellent cookbooks.
 
 Fostering this kind of material is what made Martha Stewart so respectable in what she did on her shows. Of this genre of cookbook, this is a very good sample. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for recipes from this `feel good market' venue. I think, for example, that it is more value for the money than Ina Garten's first cookbook.

329,"Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.
 
 Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.
 
 It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.
 
 Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment

It is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners. I would advise reading ""The neatest little guide to the stock market"" before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks.
 
 Here is a summary of his CAN SLIM method to making money in the stock market, this is how to buy stocks:
 C= Current quarterly earnings:are they enough?
 A=Annual earnings increases:do they have meaningful growth?
 N=New products,New management,New highs:is it time to buy?
 S=Supply and demand:Small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase.
 L=Leader or Laggard:Only buy leaders.
 I=Institutional sponsorship:A little will drive up price.
 M=Market Direction=How to determine it and follow.
 
 The final chapter is 18 common mistakes most investors make, this is excellent advice for what not to do.
 
 This book's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or P/E ratios. He justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued, when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors.

The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment.  This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education.  The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning.

336,"There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's ""The Journey"" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as ""lugubrious."") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed ""it."" But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's ""Louis and Antoinette."" As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English

348,"In a letter to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers Solzhenitsyn writes, ""Lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society, that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a façade."" Cancer Ward is no façade.
 
 A truly moving story of life and death, disease and recovery, Cancer Ward is a novel with impact. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story. From loyal party member Pavel Nikolayevich to labor camp survivor Oleg Kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between, the virtues and faults of socialism are examined, dissected, and layed out clearly for the reader.
 
 While his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels, novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of Stalinism, Solzhenitsyn took a grave risk. He wrote novels which reflected truth. He wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people. And, in the end, he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved.
 
 Make no mistake. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was no rebel. He truly loved his country and supported his government. His use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country. It was Solzhenitsyn's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems. Alas, his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the Soviet government.
 
 Fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost. They found their way out of Russia and onto the stage of World Literature. For this we can all be thankful. Cancer Ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone's library.

349,"This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck

352,"I think this is the only book of its kind on the market now, so I would recommend it if only for this reason to women who like to dress well at low cost.  However, it's better than I expected, thanks to an author who gives very detailed information about what makes a garment well constructed, down to the buttons. This book is useful for anybody shopping for clothes anywhere, new or not. It's probably even a great gift for someone who sews their own clothes, that's how detailed it gets about garment construction. This book's main audience are women who want to get bargains on designer clothes (it even gives helpful lists of designer names and their &quot;poor cousin&quot; lines), and therefore are more likely to shop consignment rather than thrift. It's still helpful to vintage/thrift shoppers too (especially section on stain removal) but I wish she had included more tips for those shoppers, as well as more info on shoes.  I think a sequel is in order because I think the author probably has a lot more to say. If so, please include a chapter on shopping for clothes online. This book has nothing on this topic, which is an art in itself! I'd also like to recommend Al Hoff's Thrift Score

356,"Bravo for Mr. Herman!  His perspective on the affect of the British raj and, in particular, the navy on the development of the Western world is excellent and educational.  The phenomenon of a relatively small nation exerting its influence around the globe by extending its power through a superbly constructed and manned navy is, as yet, unmatched.  For fully two centuries, until World War II finally exhausted the potential, the British policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the New World through trade with the Old. This includes the United States, whose loss as a colony severely dented the Empire, but eventiually created the power which has succeeded Britain as world guarantor.
 
 Mr. Herman is good on detail, but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole. He is candid about the problems, both physical and political, and respectful of those individuals who, even in bad times, retained the foresight to keep the navy, and, thus, the Empire, on an even keel.
 
 An excellent read for anyone interested in Western history

357,"""All life/ has song..."" Stan Rice announces at the start of ""Singing Yet,"" chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases, plus several new poems. Rice (who sadly passed away at the end of 2002) displayed a flair for evocative imagery, but his poetry is so confusingly random that it's almost impossible to decipher.  
   
 The first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism (comparing melons to a woman) and odd morbidity (""It is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce""). But in the ""Some Lamb"" section, Rice delved into some deeper, more real turf: the death of his daughter from leukemia. ""We stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see.""  
   
 With an actual focus, Rice's poetry shifts into aching confusion, describing his daughter's illness, death, and burial, all the emotions that came with it. Unfortunately, Rice's poetry doesn't improve after that, including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little, Rice's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical. ""The iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers..."" 
   
 Dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem. But Rice's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible. ""Golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack, assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers?"" he announced at one point. Okay, whatever. Maybe it's about death. Interpret that as you will. While his poetry can be intriguing and seductive, most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together.  
   
 Certainly Rice can't be faulted for his lack of description. He could evoke astoundingly weird, Dali-esque images. The problem is, they seem strung together like beads. Rather than focusing on one and exploring it, he seems just to have tossed them together randomly, assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection. ""Thunder no more, sky/big sandwich gold & coral"" -- it doesn't evoke anything by itself, and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it.  
   
 An overview of Stan Rice's poetry, with a stretch of new material, ""Singing Yet"" doesn't shed any more light on what went through his head. Nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing.

The Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayo rocked, with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion.  I'd use that on any sandwich, anytime.  The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome.

The hero of the story, William Race, is what many of us would like to be:  a regular guy who, when thrust into extraordinary situations, very capably becomes the hero.  Of course the action is over the top and unrealistic.  It's supposed to be!  I tell everybody who asks that Reilly is the best action writer I've ever read.  I'm not sure why some people blast his books so bad.  Do a little research and know what you're getting into.  If you like high-powered, non-stop action, this is the guy for you.

363,"At first when I tried to read it I thought the language was a little too descriptive but I realized that it was crucial to the mindset of this time period. In 1870's New York society, detail was everything from what food you served at gatherings to the type of carriage you rode in. Everything one did or possessed made a statement about who they are and what they stood for. You get this point clearly in the beginning when the characters are introduced. The main character Newland Archer comes from a respectable family so it would make sense that he would marry May Welland who comes from the respectable Mingott family. But things don't run smoothly when May's cousin Countess Ellen Olenska returns to America after leaving her European husband. Rumors ensue among members of society forcing Newland to take sides with Ellen because of May. But soon Newland sees in Ellen a free spiritedness that he doesn't see in May. Soon he finds himself trapped in a triangle. The whole plot kept me fascinated because just when you think something is going to happen an interesting development occurs. Just remember everything isn't what it seems in the book. On the surface a party is given for a member of the family, but underneath are harsh judgments and diversions of person's intentions. By the ending I was surprised but then again not surprised. I can see why this book is still acclaimed after all these decades

The ties and the love and the betrayal, the architectual detail alone, all of it make for one of the most profound works of literature ever written.  Please do not be spoiled by the quick reads that one is most aquainted with today.  Take the time to reaquaint yourself with this extraordinary work that will leave you heartbroken and amazed by the end.

366,"At the end of this diatribe, the author admits that they don't want him back cruising. And I don't blame them. He is just one of those passengers that you can't please no matter what. Is he fussy? Let facts be submitted to a candid world: Quote: ""On the ultra luxury Radisson Diamond, the same waiters that served my partner and me were also serving a table of senior officers and VIPs. Their mineral water was poured from a bottle wrapped in a white napkin; our mineral water - the same brand (how did he know if theirs was wrapped?) -- was poured without the napkin."" Holy cow! Mineral water without a napkin - How dare they! At the same sitting, the author complains of a fish head that has fish eyes staring out at him and, guess what, the fish smells fishy! That's an earthquake! More complaints: The food isn't any better than a three star hotel! (Ever stay at a three star hotel in France? The food is super.) More whines: The VIPs get special treatments and special parties (Shocking!), the music around the pool is too loud, too rap and hard rock, the free wine on board only costs the cruise line only $2, he cracked a tooth and the cruise line wouldn't pay his dental bill until he got a lawyer friend who obtained the money plus ""a meager compensation."" But the thing that bothered me the most was his inconsistency. He berates the industry for alleged mistreatment of their employees and yet he himself seems to cause those employees more trouble that 99% of the other passengers and he can't figure out why those employees, like the bartender on page 157, whom he nagged for several days, hate him so much. He berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution, yet he himself has taken (and presumably will try to take) multiple cruises. The massive improvements in waste management and sanitation and pollution control and fuel efficiency are dismissed as not enough. He nitpicks about occasional oil spills but fails to mention that according to the US Coast Guard 99% of the oil pollution of the seas comes from natural sources, mainly undersea vents. But what's this? The author's website which is billed as a ""noncommercial site regularly updated with links to reports, investigations, and new developments regarding labor, ship safety, and security"" is not functioning. The website isn't function just the way this book isn't functioning. The best treatment for the likes of him is to throw him overboard or make him walk the plank. If you want to know about cruising, instead of reading this piece of junk, get a hold of any book by John Maxtone-Graham. His ""The Only Way to Cross"" is a classic.

What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance.  So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed.  No other work like it had been available.
 
 And what a revelation about many of them.  Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it.

369,"My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the ""dreaded"" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies

370,"Having read the Bagavad Gita, it only much later dawned on me that Carlos is Arjuna and Don Juan is Krishna - only the wisdom is completely different. But in the Gita we have Arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud, but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at Krisna's encouragement to go through with the pasage. Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - ""Karma for the Complete Idiot"".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan ""nuggets"" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite  and material trappings. And so has the Bagavad Gita

Not only did we use the book, but with some diligent work were able to arrange personal counseling sessions with Mr. Pope for both my son and daughter.
 
 We live in Central Texas and my son just graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington and my daughter is now a senior at Kalamazoo College in Michigan.

 My son loved Whitman.  It is a beautiful school in a beautiful part of America. It is not easy.  He was challenged.  There is a great respect between the college and the town of 30,000. (To parents: Walla Walla is a great place to visit.  There are 50+ wonderful wine tasting rooms in the immediate area.)
 
 My daugher also is happy with her choice at Kzoo.  The winters are cold for a Texas girl, but the personal attention that so many of the professors have given to her and her friends is amazing.

The author goes into slight tangents of historical events -- at the beginning it seems pointless.  After a while, you understand all the links, and begin to become very interested in this character that is much like many careless intellectual college drop outs who never found it fullfilling and always found themselves bound by the system.   Maybe I liked it because I identified with her -- almost too much -- even though she is far richer and always seeking to put herself in a situation most level headed people wouldn't.  That's what makes her facinating.   In hind sight, I can see why many people didn't like it, but reading it, I was devoured by her smart writing style and the storyline.  Not until 3/4ths into the book you suspect anything out of the ordinary.  Suspensful, definately.   The last chapter was kind of anticlimactic.

John MacAndrew is away trying to get his fortune back after Beatrice stole it all in an effort to keep Wideacre for her children. Julia and Richard early on seem to represent the good and bad Beatrice. Julia resembles Beatrice, and she has her excellent horse riding skills, plus the ability to farm and work the land. All those were ""the good Beatrice."" Richard only has the insatiable hunger to keep Wideacre for himself and pass it on to his heir. He doesn't care about anything or anybody else. This represents ""the bad Beatrice."" At the end of Wideacre all Beatrice could think about was raising enough money to secure Wideacre for her heirs, and she turned a blind eye to the poverty and sickness that she was causing. I like how Philippa Gregory weaves historical facts into the story, such as how the poor had to live in order to survive, and how the landowners made such unfair laws, and how they controlled the courts. The parts of the book that were really aggravating to me were the ones where Julia had absolutely no backbone whatsoever.... especially after Richard rapes her. I think Celia and John would definitely have believed her, not Richard. 
 I have really liked every Philippa Gregory book, whether from the Other Boleyn Girl series or the Wideacre series. I'm looking forward to reading the last book, Meridon.

 The recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes.  However, I found that there were too many Southwestern Chili type recipes for my taste.  If you like to make chili and lots of Mexican and Southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you.  That is not to say that there aren't some Mediterranean and Caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the Tex-Mex and Southwestern flavors beat out the others.   
 
 Also, I happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs.  I love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine.  Not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically, but diet margarine.  In the same vein I understand that the author is an M.S., R.D. but I really don't think there is a need to use Fat-Free Dressing for everything.  I also didn't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix.  I have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods. Thus, I get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients.  
 
 One more irksome tidbit was the fact that there weren't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi, adzuki, flageolet, cranberry to name a few.
 
 This cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook can offer

But for only four dollars, what was there to lose?  I was in for a surprise and a real treat!  This book not only captures the teenage insecurities that most of us have felt, or are feeling, but it also captures that nervous, excited, almost panicked feeling a lot of us get after graduating high school, and moving on into the &quot;real&quot; world.  The book was unique in many many ways.  The first third of the book was the main character describing a history of her life by describing pictures she had found, and giving a short story for each one.  The second section, told from her point of view, gave the reader insight into her high school life, dealing with peer pressure, school, and dating.  In the third part of the book,  she begins college, and also begins to spiral out of control, and the books tone shows this.

391,"This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.  
 
 I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup. 
 
 The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.

392,"I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality. 
 
 It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.
 
 Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the ""mental life"" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of ""woman"" or ""man""; and so on. 
 
 Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.
 
 Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's ""wrong"" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing ""that kind"" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward ""druglike"" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.
 
 Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a ""user"", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a ""user"".) 
 
 It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex. 
 
 This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a ""real"" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples. 
 
 A woman who lays there ""unfeeling"" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.
 
 On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he ""spoilt"" her. 
 
 As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.
 
 These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and ""perform"". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part. 
 
 Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men ""want to hear"". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being ""sexist"". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not ""come to the crisis"" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man. 
 
 It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as ""intimacy"" and ""connection"", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child. 
 
 So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman ""should"" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.
 
 There's a lot of talk of ""tenderness"" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow ""lacking tenderness"" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find. 
 
 I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.
 
 For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.

 There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books.
 I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.
 
 The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members. 
 
 I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.

396,"This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not.  The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best.  Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius.

Yes, my state is a gun toting state but that doesn't mean that none of these people want a little safety once in a while.

400,"The book I read was Championship Ball, by Clair Bee. Championship Ball is about a high school basketball player named Chip. Chip is an extremely good athlete and is a starting basketball player for his high school. Everything was going great until something happened that would change Chips life forever. During a basketball game Chip got tripped up and hit the ground hard. As Chip was writhing in pain, the team trainer came out to assist him. As it turned out Chip had fractured his ankle in several places. It was pretty bad which would mean that he would have to watch the games from the team bench for the rest of the year most likely. As his team goes on without him, they are doing quite well. They are making a championship run, and they are doing quite well, and they eventually get there. Before the big championship game, Chip was begging his coach to let him play. Chip's coach is not sure if Chip is
 ready to play just yet, but Chip is by far the best athlete on the team. Will Chip get to play in the big game, or will he have to spend yet another game spectating from the bench.
 I really enjoyed the book because it is very suspenseful, and it is hard to put down. It is suspenseful because throughout the book the author does not tell you Chips condition in its entirety, and whether or not he will get to play in the up coming games. There was on thing that I did not like about the book and that is the repetitiveness. It seemed like every time a big game was about to unfold, the same thing happened on the court. Also every time Chip asked his coach to play, he always said no, so you kind of almost expect it. 
 My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it is very well put together. Also if you are into sports or you like suspense and action, then you will probably love this book because it has all of these aspects.

402,"...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:
 
 1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.
 
 2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.
 
 3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island ""mystery"" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.
 
 4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.
 
 Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.

However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.

 If you want to get an ""inside view"" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!
 
 What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!
 
 I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.

410,"Similar to other books in his US history series, Vidal engages the reader immediately into conspiracies and dramas by introducing a wide panorama of characters. Vidal is able to use Burr's assistant, Charles Schuyler, as the chief storyteller, allowing the narrative to skip around through time. Vidal likes to have the narrator tell the reader that the past ""isn't like it is now,"" which he would not be able to do if the story followed a strict chronological series. Characters are given incredible depth as they all have their dark faults to go with their heroic strengths. Vidal takes shots at the big guys. Some shots are substantial (like saying Washington was a poor leader who never lead the Army into a victory and only won the War because of France) and some are petty (Washington repeatedly viewed as having a ""big butt"" and often referred to as ""waddling""). Jefferson is especially scrutinized. Besides the ubiquitous presence of light-skinned slaves insinuated to be of the Jefferson line, Jefferson is portrayed as a cold, calculating ""philosopher king"" who uses the constitution when it supports his causes, but calls for ""states rights"" when the constitution contradicts him.
 
 Aaron Burr, who despite all the nasty politicking going on around him, is portrayed as a gentleman who is constantly antagonized by his peers for trying to do the right thing. How he obtains so much power in the state of New York is not really pursued except to say he is a war hero. Also, Tammany is often mentioned in the background, but Burr's involvement is not pursued. However, Burr is always described as having control of the New York constituencies that he can influence when making deals with the Virginia ""junta.""
 
 My only negative critique is I find it hard to believe that Burr was vilified by conspirators without having character flaws that might have contributed to his rise and fall.  Burr is always the benevolent gentleman while the other power mongers of the day (Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience. Vidal freely flings the mud at other historical heroes, but seems a little too defensive and paranoid about the reputation of Aaron Burr. Still, the book is rich with historical vignettes of Burr's meetings with various patriotic heroes. Vidal writes with enough veneration to let you know the characters are great and enough vindication to make them real.

415,"This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?). 
 
 He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.
 
 The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)
 
 On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case. 
 
 What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.
 
 So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.
 
 My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones

I was expecting stories of the traditional ""alien encounter"" type, but that's not what's in here.  They're not horribly written, just not really what the book promises.

417,"Among the books in defense of globalization, this is among the best for the methodlogical care with which the author has presented his arguments. The text is lucid and very appropriate for students. Perhaps the only deficiency is a reluctance to engage the question of institutional reform with the WTO that could potentially compromise environmental and social protection. The failure of the Doha round and the WSSD in this regard is neglected. However, the author does an admirable job debunking a lot of myths that are so vitriolically presented by antiglobalization activists.

418,"THE CRANKY DAY is made up of three stories: Cranky Bugs, Put-Upon Percy, and Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. This inexpensive paperback is perfect for the Thomas fan. It has the colorful photographic ""illustrations"" that look like the series we're familiar with. This one is REALLY popular with my Thomas fans, and you can read the stories one at a time or all three at once. But beware -- when you're finished they're going to want you to read it again! and again! and again

419,"This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.
 
 Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.
 
 Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as ""harken"" rather than ""hearken""). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention

421,"The idea was to have the essentials of AC/DC circuit analysis, linear circuits, electronic circuits, digital logic circuit design, electromechanical machines, and control theory in one handy outline. The problem is, any one of these subjects is way too complex and deep as it is presented in most universities for the book to be helpful for undergraduate electrical engineering students. Also, on the whole, this material is far from basic. The material on electromechanical machines and control theory is usually taught in junior or senior undergraduate courses.Thus, this book would be most helpful to a professional or someone returning to graduate school for a master's degree in electrical engineering who needs some review on material that they have previously mastered but possibly forgotten. Unfortunately, as the other reviewer pointed out, this book is chock full of errors, thus rendering the book pretty much useless in the problem solving department. If a revised second edition of this book ever comes out with corrections to all of the current errors, I would recommend it to the target audience I have already mentioned, but definitely not to undergraduate engineers who are seeing this material for the first time

But the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is *shorter* than the  moon's cycle of 29 1/2 days, so it won't stay in step. (Besides, many  women's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average.) Z. also  says the Earth and Sun are getting closer together at the Northern  Hemisphere's summer solstice; that's actually close to aphelion.

He is a rabbit-eared Bandicoot, one of an endangered species, familiarly known in Australia as the BILBY. *Aussie* reviewer ""LIN"" won me over by suggesting that ""Hunwick's Egg"" would be a great Easter gift. Hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch. 
 
 They are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug: a cockatoo, an  echidna (resembling a porcupine), and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *Bryll Cream* . . . Hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen! But still the egg does not hatch. The plant life is gorgeous, drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils. I am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus, and other green wildflowers.
 
 After referring to my dictionary I felt tricked into falling for a RAT, of all things. I don't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature!

 However, one need not read the entire book to find out Bhagwati's views.  Bhagwati's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis.  As a Harvard professor, I would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms.  However, his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not

426,"This collection of short stories was given to me by a good friend. With one or two exceptions, it concerns women confronting decisions - from the most mundane to the fairly serious. What sets these stories apart, in addition to the fine writing style, are the decisions made by these women. They are never politically correct or predictable. At times the reader may find the direction taken by the author to be controversial, even uncomfortable. I know I asked myself during several stories, ""Now why the heck would she do that?"" I suspect that was the point being made by the author and what is the ultimate joy of the book - to force the reader to accept each character as independent of any predispositions by the reader.
 
 The author uses sarcasm and more conventional humor where the average reader is least likely to expect it. She takes simple stories and sends them in unexpected directions. My favorite story in the collection was ""I Thought You Said You Love Me"", perhaps because it was the most conventional. That said, ""Model Job"" was just as enjoyable, but most unconventional.
 
 Treat yourself to something different and read ""Inside Out."" The author is preparing to publish a volume of poetry, which should be a treat indeed!

427,"Mitchell's writing, as stated in the reviews, takes the scholarship begun by Heidegger and continued by Derrida and Foucault and applies it to his critique of 19th century colonialism.  The ideas of deconstruction and its fight to overturn both complete objectivity and the hope of &quot;overcoming the system&quot; lead Mitchell to demonstrate that the West and its objectivity is rooted in as much subjectivity as any other cultural perspective.  It is this Western rationale that brought European colonialists to impose their values and hierarchies onto the Oriental system, bringing the power structures of Foucault's discourses to the fore.  Whatever conclusion you come to take from the book, and Mitchell's arguments are exceptionally convincing, you will certainly not leave its pages with the same mindset you entered

428,"Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, ""Okay, give it your best shot!""  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn

429,"One of the more interesting topics in this book is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  While there is much more in the book than this portion, I think Huband's treatment of this conflict is so far off that it compromises the entire work.  And Huband begins the section by quoting an Arab who says that although Israelis say they want peace, they do not really want it.
 
 Well, what are we to make of this?  After all, we know that the Israelis, good or bad, do want peace and do need peace.  They spent the past several decades building up a nation.  And they want to keep it.  That is one reason they need peace.  And that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace, just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook.  But just as fish need food, Israelis need peace.
 
 Huband didn't say that.  
 
 But we know that Israelis really do want peace.  We know that if Israelis are innocent victims, they want peace.  We know that if Israelis are guilty thieves, they still want peace, just to keep their illicit gains.  What does it mean for Huband to imply that Israelis do not really want (or do not really appear to want) peace?  
 
 Well such a claim is surely a falsehood.  But more than that, it is a taunt.  After all, suppose a bully decides to beat you up.  And suppose that bully claims you want to fight!  Obviously, you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up.  What the bully is saying is a taunt.  It's more than a mere falsehood.  It is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims.  
 
 That means that Huband's book is taunting Israelis.  That's not a very good thing for a journalist to do.  It goes beyond telling mere falsehoods.
 
 Huband also implies that Jews have taken Arab land, and admit to it.  And that they have taken an Arab country!  I wonder which one?  And I also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes ""taking"" it.   After all, we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805.  Not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today.  Have we all stolen the planet from them?  Of course not.  We have bought it and inherited it.  There has been some theft, but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today.
 
 Huband implies that the Arabs ought to have a greater right to steal Jewish land than the Jews do to own the land they bought at high prices.  That's bad journalism too.
 
 And there's more.  The author calls former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ""extremist.""  Now, I might understand making some snide remark about former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who after all was a former leader of the Stern Gang.  One might even do the same for former Prime Minister Menachim Begin, who was a former leader of the Irgun.  But Netanyahu?  Once again, this is poor journalism.  And by the way, you might want to see how often the author calls any Arabs ""extremists.""
 
 It is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the Arab world has reminded many Israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in Germany in the 1930s.  And that has resulted in some analogies being made between Arab antisemitism today and German antisemitism before and during World War Two.  Huband makes fun of such analogies.  I think he should have taken them seriously.  More bad journalism.
 
 The author does take Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi seriously, though.  Huband quotes him to explain that the Arabs are ""innocent bystanders,"" and that the Jews are visiting revenge on the Arabs for European antisemitism!  This is total nonsense, of course.  More bad journalism.  
 
 Now, does a ""one-state"" solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict make sense?  Maybe so.  Israel exists in order to protect Jewish rights and to provide a refuge for Jews.  It exists to provide a state where Jews will speak Hebrew natively, attend Hebrew schools universities, have Hebrew traditions, and so forth.  It can do all that in a state which has a large non-Jewish population.  And Israel, even with ten thousand square miles, would be rather small for a state which houses over five million Jews.  If Jewish rights to life, liberty, property, and immigration are protected, a one-state solution may be best.  Besides, while many people say that another Arab state is needed as well, I see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy Israel.
 
 The author agrees that a one-state solution is best.  And I think he even acknowledges that Israel is part of the Middle East.  But it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish Jewish rights rather than support them.  And getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region.

432,"Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10&quot; x 10&quot;, that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible.

 After the first few chapters, I could not wait for it to end. The ultimate horror of this book is reserved for those compelled to finish any book they start.
 
 As has been mentioned in other reviews. WE GET IT. The woods are ""SCARY"" and their presence is pervasive. The characters themselves, despite the author's intent, are also wooden, and if the reader experiences any fear, it is the fear of being infected by the banality and possible mental retardation of Heather Price and her insufferable family. 
 
 The best way to describe the story for me is this: It's a fairy tale. Its simplistic writing style and unsophisticated fear-factor could have very easily been told in 5 or 6 pages, and inserted invisibly into a volume of Grimm's. As such, it would have been a much better tale with at least the healthy moral about the hazards in spending too much time with your crazy Aunt.
 
 As a novel, it is pure water torture. If the trees ever do revolt, useless wastes of paper such as this piece will most certainly be causative.

436,"After reading the Oprah Pick, ""What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in ""Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do.""  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.  
 
 I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.  
 
 I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope

 The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete.  The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid.  As a case in point, I have not forgotten--nor will I ever forget--the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail AS HE'S BEING EATEN.

 My reasons for such an accusation:
 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling.
 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.)

445,"I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).  
 
 Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of ""references"" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.  
 
 I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  But in this case it would seem: ""With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.

446,"This book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers. He teaches you almost everything on the market's technical behavior. 
 
 The naive part is that he uses, in my humble opinion, old school indicators - like 50SMA and 200SMA. Also, he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions. Of course, I wish this were true but I think in today's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that. 
 
 So what does there need to be? I don't know, but let me tell you one important thing: Just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back, don't let that fool you into thinking that's how the market is _always_ going to behave.

447,"I wanted to teach my son to program and chose VB and this book.  This book really ""looks"" great but I'm not impressed by the content. So much so that it compelled me to write my first ever book review.
 
 The introduction ""Who Is This Book For?"" gives a sense that this book can get people into programming.   I would be amazed however if anyone not familiar with programming will get past Chapter 1 without being frightened by the whole prospect of programming.  Chapter 1 initially jumps into some Microsoft marketing of .Net which really adds nothing but confuses the readers by having to deal with line after line of computer jargon.  Then the chapter gives a horrible overview of Object Orientation which again doesn't help later.
 
 I feel the whole book is like the first chapter. Doesn't give you some of the basics but rambles about more complex stuff you don't need between some hands on practical stuff. 
 
 I actually thought the first example was really poor also.  I am of the opinion that someone typing something in themselves and seeing it work should be rewarding.  The example however was hard for a novice as it had long lines of comments and the line to print the variables was a minefield of quotes and symbols making it pretty likely that a beginner would do a typo.  
 
 The title of the book is ""Build a Program Now!"".  This the book does and given how complex setting up an environment it is helpful.  But I've slammed the rating of this book because this could have covered with a lot less pages and maybe substitute some of the drivel with a little about the syntax of VB or even some explanation of the example code.
 
 DON'T buy this book if you think it will teach you anything about computing or programming.
 
 DO buy this book if you have some other teaching reference for Visual Basic and want something that will help you setup your build environment.  Also comes with a VB Express CD so you don't have to downloaded it.

448,"When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own ""Notes From a Small Island"" and ""A Walk in the Woods"", read by Ron Mclarty.
 
 In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to ""In a Sunburned Country"" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that ""Neither Here Nor There"" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of ""In a Sunburned Country"" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia

449,"Deaver's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound.  He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white.
 
 In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle.
 
 This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan.  The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom.
 
 As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons.
 
 1.  When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize.  In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who ""speak in tongues.""  And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be.
 
 2.  The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs.  We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot.
 
 3.  Implausibility.  There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess.
 
 4.  My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers.  In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of ""like""s and ""way lame""s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake.  I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous.

Yet today i beleive we can con verese with most anyone & arrive at these type mind games on our own without the need of a therapist.     If i were able to time travel back to the '60s, Woodstock, Timothy Leary,...& read this book with ""that"" mind-set, i would rate the book 5 big stars

454,"Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.' 
 
 The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.  
 
 Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom. 
 
 Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.

Honestly, I expected it to have your standard sword exercises and cuts, but it contains stances and techniques that I have never even heard of, while some are familiar to me. Thanks to having a hardwood bokuto (which I also purchased off of this website), I can now incorporate new exercises into my practice.

Anna's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome. I also missed Anna's sister, Molly, who is only mentioned a few times in the book. 
 
 Sorry, but I really can't recommend this book as a good read. If you want to get a feel for a real Anna Pigeon adventure, pick up ""Track of the Cat"" or ""Liberty Falling.

459,"This is a very well researched book.  The author has taken great pains to measure and analyze Vermeer's paintings, finding a striking feature that many of them, when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting, imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures.  The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.
 
 This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.
 
 I think the only real failing in the argument is that Vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality, and therefore not needed the aid of a camera.  As pointed out in the text, he was not bound to perfect accuracy; there are some deviations

460,"I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little. 
 
 I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists. 
 
 It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards

462,"Even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book, which is a compilation of several of MKF Fisher's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin, recipes, culinary preparation, and history. In addition, it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs, etiquette, ambience, socializing and so forth. But what makes this book stellar is the eloquent, imaginative, and sometimes even haunting style of Ms. Fisher's writing. She expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions, mixing them with historical facts, tempting recipes, and home-cooked tales. With such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers, it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining. I wish I had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food, eating, and drinking, which after all are such basic elements to our very existence.  
 
 The section I enjoyed most of all was ""The Gastronomical Me"", a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes. She includes food episodes of her early years in California while growing up and later attending boarding school; in Dijon, France where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings; in Switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the Alps to Italy; and finally in a small Mexican town, where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories, by telling the most poignant tales. 
 
 An interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food. You gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics, from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of Pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon, which she keeps in a flask during a long, propeller-driven, airplane flight to Mexico. 
 
 The other sections I liked were the beginning (Serve It Forth) and Consider the Oyster. It amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster: the various types, methods of preparations, and culinary history. Plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too. You name it, she said it about oysters--recipes included. 
 
 I did not care as much for How to Cook a Wolf, as I could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented. (Sorry, but sweetbreads, halves of calf heads, and brains were not appetizing subjects.) Also, I gave up finishing the book. I started to read ""An Alphabet for Gourmets"", the last section, but got as far as ""D"" and couldn't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet. It seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter, to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending. This section was such a let-down, a depressant to me after coming off the high of ""The Gastronomical Me"". Although I exaggerate, she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people (with untrained palettes) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second. Anyway, other readers may disagree with me, but this last section lacks the consistency, and more important, the vibrancy and pep of her flowing, off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections.  
 
 Although I was a little disheartened at the end, her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives.  I can recommend this book to everyone, especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat. Of course, foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it. And though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses, this should not be considered a cookbook; instead, this book's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy.

I also thought there might be some therapeutic or life management benefit in listening to this book.  However, the author merely lists the ""gifts"" (personality tendencies) and describes the emotions of abandoned children, but does little by way of giving ideas for healing oneself or dealing with the ongoing relationships between our relatives and others.  The content and gentle delivery might be helpful to those still grieving or those still trying to put their feelings into words; but, it does little for listeners at the next level seeking solutions or strategies

He dismisses the action of these advocates as  puritanical and fundamentally ignorant of the real conditions of the  children's lives. He decides that children are neither powerless nor  defenseless, and this decision is, of course, a double-edged sword when  dealing with the very real abuses of child labor and child exploitation  that still pervade the U.S. and the globe

467,"Don't read this book. I wish I hadn't. It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime.
 
 We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will.
 
 This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about.
 
 The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, ""this is somebody else's fault"" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done.
 
 If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record. I read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom I heard so much growing up. I now wish I didn't know 4/5ths of what I now do know about you.

468,"This is a tremendously expensive reference that one should expect to be trustworthy. But it isn't. Nor is it as definitive as should be expected, though it does have some fascinating entries, such as the role of dogs in the history of food. For the price, there should be line drawings for some of the more unusual fruits and veg, because as it is, the verbal descriptions would lead a reader to think that something looked quite different than it does. So I use these two volumes with caution, referencing further anything said here before I take it as a given. Although some other reviewers here have criticized the dryness of style, that is what I want in this sort of thing, so I have no complaints there. Of far more importance is the slant that many of the articles have, which clearly have a political agenda that the information is wrapped around. So, while the bibliographies for same are useful, they also are selectively chosen. Given the guides to food now, and the many histories, I would think that a few books judiciously chosen are better value than this one reference, though if you are monied, this is an interesting addition to your library, to be read with a grain of salt in every 'Oh, my! I didn't know that.'

 Inflation would eat up the redistributed $10,000, and, unless the ""gift"" money were indexed to inflation, that $10,000 would be worth about $100 in a couple of years. Inflation would come in many forms: higher rents, higher food and fuel bills, etc. For example, an important reason for a food stamp being a food stamp is not just to ensure that the money is spent on food, but also to ensure that more paper money isn't loosed upon the economy causing unforeseen inflationary pressures. Food stamps do not cause inflation; Murray's program most certainly would.

Before completing the account of the assaults, he jumps to the sortie by the British on the night of October 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts.

The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.

We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.

It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value.

489,"Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of ""people, profits, and planet"" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well. 
 
 It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking?
 
 At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet.
 
 There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money. 
 
 There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business. 
 
 Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that.
 
 Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new

I have a bunch of cookbooks and this is the one I continually go back to to compare recipes. I sold baked good at a farmers market and his Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies got rave reviews. He also gives so many options on a way to change a recipe. Like his cheescake. He gives you a way to light it up or make a dense one. He troublshoots each recipe in case something did go wrong. Very good book

491,"this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho

492,"As a talk show host I am accustom to being inundated with requests from PR folks trying to get me to book their particular client on my show to plug their book. Since I didn't like my current events show to be a blatant advertisement for a writer, I generally delete these types of solicitation ...25 times a day. In fact I had hit delete on the email regarding Chris Prentiss's book just as my eye caught a phrase and I had to actually retrieve the message. It was the cure rate of better than 80% that got my attention, and triggered my skepticism...along with a tiny sliver of hope since I knew how many times friends and members of my own family had fallen off the wagon. I booked Chris for 15 minutes and they sent me the book. A few days beforehand I thought I better skim the book so I could ask him some tough questions. I read the entire book and called the pr representative back and booked Chris for the entire show. I think what hooked me was Chris's comment about observing an AA meeting where people were `white knuckling their way through sobriety"". Controversial statement. And true for too many. The book was specific about the path. Find the underlying cause(s). Work on that. The true story of his son's journey was engaging and encouraging. For weeks and months after the show I received emails and phone calls from listeners: ""What was the name of that guy again? What's the name of his book?"" Of all the shows and topics I have covered in 17 years on air, I have never received such a response.

493,"Most of the reviews above are political diatribes against Keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something COULD be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't. expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place. Although difficult to read, this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics. Far from being destructive, it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930's. I recommend you read this book

494,"Kingsland is biology by training therefore many scientific concepts in this book are very welled summarized and organized, making it easy for professionals and non-professional as well to grasp the general ideas in population biology. However, this book focus more on the historical context and the personality of some key scientists in this area, which gives readers more indepth understanding outside science itself. The auther did a wonderful job in interweaving science and human sides, and made it easy to pick up some major transitions in the history of population biology. highly recommmended to professional population ecologists, and general public who is interested in science as well! a bonus: some pictures of famous scientists in this area, such as McArthur, Lokta, Volttera etc...it's interesting to me, after reading all their work, finally had a chance to see what they look like

495,"I bought and read this book many years ago and found it very helpful. I read it again a few weeks ago and was again able to appreciate it's value. Aside from the dated research, and some of the debate regarding the use of anti-depressants, it remains as fresh and powerful and relevant today as it was when it was published. It is definitely a giant step in taking the mystery out of depression and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the nature and treatment of this illness

496,"I read this book hoping for a clear understanding of Buddhism.  This book is written very bland.  Very few pictures too.  I find it difficult to read and follow.

497,"I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  But after 450 pages I gave up.  Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.
 
 This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years.  I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read. 
 
 The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying

498,"In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.
 
 If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.
 
 The first chapter is written in a maudlin, ""those-were-the-good-old-days"" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say ""Erin Go Braugh"" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.
 
 Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as ""It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism,"" or ""they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism."" These ""Morris mind-reads"" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.
 
 Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!
 
 But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.
 
 Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.
 
 Benjamin Franklin said ""Statistics is a liar."" Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.
 
 Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in ""Moby Dick,"" we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: ""I caught a fish this big!""
 
 There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.
 
 In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!

499,"Those of us in the change and transition business are vocal, loud and some would say, obnoxious advocates for recognizing the human side and impact of change.  Too often our words fall on deaf ears...with &quot;True Partnerships&quot; we finally have a text that deals with NEW principles for relating to others during, before and after change.  We finally have a text that deals with the potential destructiveness of autonomy, power, scarcity mentality and victimhood.  Instead this book awakens a call to action for relationships that produce extraordinary results by shifting our philosophy to one of connection, communication, expansion and creator/observer.  It is powerful, beyond words and is guaranteed to cause you to examine your own approach of &quot;drift&quot; versus &quot;true partnership.&quot;  It can shake you up and transform your relationships at work, at home and everywhere inbetween.  Read it and begin relating differently today
